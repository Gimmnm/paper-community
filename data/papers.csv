2503.22662v1,Three-phase Muskat problem: uniform lifespan with respect to the distance between interfaces,Ángel Castro; Liangchen Zou,"We consider the three-phase Muskat problem with different densities and the same viscosities. We study the lifespan of the solutions with respect to the distance between interfaces, $d$. It is shown that if the initial distance, $d_0$, satisfies $\sigma/2<d_0<\sigma$, with $\sigma>0$ small, then the existence time in real-analytic spaces does not depend on $\sigma.$",AP,AP,1,0
2503.22621v1,Improved error estimates for low-regularity integrators using space-time bounds,Maximilian Ruff,"We prove optimal convergence rates for certain low-regularity integrators applied to the one-dimensional periodic nonlinear Schr\""odinger and wave equations under the assumption of $H^1$ solutions. For the Schr\""odinger equation we analyze the exponential-type scheme proposed by Ostermann and Schratz in 2018, whereas in the wave case we treat the corrected Lie splitting proposed by Li, Schratz, and Zivcovich in 2023. We show that the integrators converge with their full order of one and two, respectively. In this situation only fractional convergence rates were previously known. The crucial ingredients in the proofs are known space-time bounds for the solutions to the corresponding linear problems. More precisely, in the Schr\""odinger case we use the $L^4$ Strichartz inequality, and for the wave equation a null form estimate. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a null form estimate is exploited in numerical analysis. We apply the estimates for continuous time, thus avoiding potential losses resulting from discrete-time estimates.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2503.22599v1,Zero-homogeneous and $O(2)$-equivariant critical points of the Oseen-Frank energy with multiple Frank constants,Luc Nguyen,We give an existence and classification result for zero-homogeneous and $O(2)$-equivariant critical points of the Oseen-Frank energy with multiple Frank constants. These critical points carry a topological defect of degree one and are minimizing with respect to $O(2)$-equivariant perturbations supported away from the axis of symmetry.,AP,AP,1,0
2503.22439v1,One dimensional wave equation with in-domain localized damping and Wentzell boundary conditions,Abdelhakim Dahmani; Yacine Chitour; Hoai-Minh Nguyen; Christophe Roman,"This paper is devoted to the exponential stability for one-dimensional linear wave equations with in-domain localized damping and several types of Wentzell (or dynamic) boundary conditions. In a quite general boundary setting, we establish the exponential decay of solutions towards the corresponding steady states. The results are obtained either by the multiplier method or spectral analysis in an $L^2$-functional framework, and then with input-to-state technics in an $L^p$-functional framework for $p \in (2,\infty)$.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.22432v1,Polynomial stability of wind turbine tower models,Mohamed Fkirine; Lassi Paunonen,"We investigate the stabilization of mathematical models describing the structural dynamics of monopile wind turbine towers. In the fore-aft plane, we show that the system becomes polynomially stable with an energy decay rate of $t^{-1}$ under static output feedback that relies on the velocity and/or angular velocity of the nacelle. Additionally, we prove that a tuned mass damper (TMD) in the nacelle ensures polynomial stability with the same energy decay rate, offering a viable alternative to active control. For the side-to-side plane, we analyze a model incorporating a hydraulic power transmission system and prove that feedback from the nacelle's angular velocity and the generator load torque leads to polynomial stability of the system.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.22371v1,Critical double phase problems involving sandwich-type nonlinearities,Csaba Farkas; Alessio Fiscella; Ky Ho; Patrick Winkert,"In this paper we study problems with critical and sandwich-type growth represented by   \begin{equation*}   -\operatorname{div}\Big(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u + a(x)|\nabla u|^{q-2}\nabla u\Big) = \lambda w(x)|u|^{s-2}u+\theta B\left(x,u\right) \quad\text{in } \Omega,\quad u = 0 \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega,   \end{equation*}   where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary $\partial\Omega$, $1<p<s<q<N$, $\frac{q}{p}<1+\frac{1}{N}$, $0\leq a(\cdot)\in C^{0,1}(\overline{\Omega})$, $\lambda$, $\theta$ are real parameters, $w$ is a suitable weight and $B\colon \overline{\Omega}\times \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is given by   \begin{align*}   B(x,t) :=b_0(x)|t|^{p^*-2}t+b(x)|t|^{q^*-2}t,   \end{align*}   where $r^*:=Nr/(N-r)$ for $r\in\{p,q\}$. Here the right-hand side combines the effect of a critical term given by $B(\cdot,\cdot)$ and a sandwich-type perturbation with exponent $s \in (p,q)$. Under different values of the parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$, we prove the existence and multiplicity of solutions to the problem above. For this, we mainly exploit different variational methods combined with topological tools, like a new concentration-compactness principle, a suitable truncation argument and the Krasnoselskii's genus theory, by considering very mild assumptions on the data $a(\cdot)$, $b_0(\cdot)$ and $b(\cdot)$.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.22297v1,A posteriori error estimates for the finite element discretization of second-order PDEs set in unbounded domains,T. Chaumont-Frelet,"We consider second-order PDE problems set in unbounded domains and discretized by Lagrange finite elements on a finite mesh, thus introducing an artificial boundary in the discretization. Specifically, we consider the reaction diffusion equation as well as Helmholtz problems in waveguides with perfectly matched layers. The usual procedure to deal with such problems is to first consider a modeling error due to the introduction of the artificial boundary, and estimate the remaining discretization error with a standard a posteriori technique. A shortcoming of this method, however, is that it is typically hard to obtain sharp bounds on the modeling error. In this work, we propose a new technique that allows to control the whole error by an a posteriori error estimator. Specifically, we propose a flux-equilibrated estimator that is slightly modified to handle the truncation boundary. For the reaction diffusion equation, we obtain fully-computable guaranteed error bounds, and the estimator is locally efficient and polynomial-degree-robust provided that the elements touching the truncation boundary are not too refined. This last condition may be seen as an extension of the notion of shape-regularity of the mesh, and does not prevent the design of efficient adaptive algorithms. For the Helmholtz problem, as usual, these statements remain valid if the mesh is sufficiently refined. Our theoretical findings are completed with numerical examples which indicate that the estimator is suited to drive optimal adaptive mesh refinements.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

This is done via complex deformation of the interval on which Rayleigh equation is considered. We show such resonances are inviscid limits of the eigenvalues of the corresponding Orr--Sommerfeld equation.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.22142v1,A New Structure for the 2D water wave equation: Energy stability and Global well-posedness,Qingtang Su; Siwei Wang,"We study the two-dimensional gravity water waves with a one-dimensional interface with small initial data. Our main contributions include the development of two novel localization lemmas and a Transition-of-Derivatives method, which enable us to reformulate the water wave system into the following simplified structure: $$(D_t^2-iA\partial_{\alpha})\theta=i\frac{t}{\alpha}|D_t^2\zeta|^2D_t\theta+R$$ where $R$ behaves well in the energy estimate. As a key consequence, we derive the uniform bound $$   \sup_{t\geq 0}\Big(\norm{D_t\zeta(\cdot,t)}_{H^{s+1/2}}+\norm{\zeta_{\alpha}(\cdot,t)-1}_{H^s}\Big)\leq C\epsilon, $$ which enhances existing global uniform energy estimates for 2D water waves by imposing less restrictive constraints on the low-frequency components of the initial data.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.22090v1,Relatively non-degenerate integrated decay estimates on subextremal Kerr de Sitter,Georgios Mavrogiannis,"We study the Klein--Gordon equation $\Box\psi-\mu^2_{\textit{KG}}\psi=0$ on subextremal Kerr de Sitter black hole backgrounds with parameters $(a,M,l)$, where $l^2=\frac{3}{\Lambda}$. We prove a ""relatively non degenerate integrated"" decay estimate assuming an appropriate mode stability statement for real frequency solutions of Carter's radial ode. Our results, in particular, apply unconditionally in the very slowly rotating case $|a|\ll M,l$, and in the case where $\psi$ is axisymmetric. Exponential decay for $\psi$ to a constant is a consequence of this estimate.   To prove our result, we introduce a novel pseudodifferential commutation operator $\mathcal{G}$ that generalizes our previous purely physical space commutation \cite{mavrogiannis} and we use it in conjunction with the Morawetz estimate of our companion \cite{mavrogiannis4}. This pseudodifferential operator is defined using Fourier decomposition with respect to time frequencies $\omega$ and azimuthal frequencies $m$, but does not require Carter's full separation.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.22086v1,"Multiplicity and uniqueness of positive solutions for a superlinear-singular $(p,q)$-Laplacian equation on locally finite graphs",Xuechen Zhang; Xingyong Zhang,"We investigate the multiplicity and uniqueness of positive solutions for the superlinear singular $(p,q)$-Laplacian equation \begin{eqnarray*}   \begin{cases} -\Delta_p u-\Delta_q u+a(x)u^{p-1}+b(x)u^{q-1}=f(x)u^{-\gamma}+\lambda g(x)u^{\alpha}, \;\;\;\;\hfill \mbox{in}\;\; V,\\ u>0,\;\;u\in W_a^{1,p}(V) \cap W_b^{1,q}(V),   \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} on a weighted locally finite graph $G=(V,E)$, where $0<\gamma<1<q\leq p<\alpha+1$, $\lambda$ is a parameter, the potential functions $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ satisfy some suitable conditions, $f>0, g \geq 0$, $f\in L^1(V)\cap L^{\frac{p}{p-1+\gamma}}(V) \cap L^{\frac{q}{q-1+\gamma}}(V)$ and $g\in L^1(V)\cap L^\infty(V)$. By making use of the method of Nehari manifold and the Ekeland's variational principle, we prove that there exist two positive solutions for $\lambda$ belonging to some precise interval. Besides, we also investigate the existence and uniqueness of positive solution for $\lambda<0$. We overcome some difficulties which are caused by: $(i)$ the singular term; $(ii)$ the definition of gradient $|\nabla u|$ on graph which is different from that on $\mathbb{R}^N$; $(iii)$ the lack of compactness of Sobolev embedding.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.22077v1,Boundedness and Morawetz estimates on subextremal Kerr de Sitter,Georgios Mavrogiannis,"We study the Klein--Gordon equation $\Box_{g_{a,M,l}}\psi-\mu^2_{\textit{KG}}\psi=0$ on subextremal Kerr--de Sitter black hole backgrounds with parameters $(a,M,l)$, where $l^2=\frac{3}{\Lambda}$. We prove boundedness and Morawetz estimates assuming an appropriate mode stability statement for real frequency solutions of Carter's radial ode. Our results in particular apply in the very slowly rotating case $|a|\ll M,l$, and in the case where the solution~$\psi$ is axisymmetric. This generalizes the work of Dafermos--Rodnianski \cite{DR3} on Schwarzschild--de~Sitter.   The boundedness and Morawetz results of the present paper will be used in our companion \cite{mavrogiannis2} to prove a `relatively non-degenerate integrated estimate' for subextremal Kerr--de Sitter black holes~(and as a consequence exponential decay). In a forthcoming paper \cite{mavrogiannis3}, this will immediately yield nonlinear stability results for quasilinear wave equations on subextremal Kerr--de Sitter backgrounds.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.22070v1,Quantum Quasi-neutral limits and isothermal Euler Equations,Immanuel Ben Porat; Gui-Qiang G. Chen; Difan Yuan,"We provide a rigorous justification of the semiclassical quasi-neutral and the quantum many-body limits to the isothermal Euler equations. We consider the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger-Poisson-Boltzmann system under a quasi-neutral scaling and establish the convergence of its solutions to the isothermal Euler equations. Different from the previous results that dealt with the linear Poisson equations, the system under our consideration accounts for the exponential nonlinearity in the potential. A modulated energy method is adopted, allowing us to derive the stability estimates and asymptotics. Furthermore, we focus our analysis on the many-body quantum problem via the von Neumann equation and establish a mean-field limit in one dimension by using Serfaty's functional inequalities, and thus connecting the quantum many-body dynamics with the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations. A refined analysis of the quasi-neutral scaling for the massless systems is presented, and the well-posedness of the underlying quantum dynamics is established. Moreover, the construction of general admissible initial data is obtained. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical analysis for the derivation of quantum hydrodynamic models and their limits, contributing to the broader understanding of interactions between quantum mechanics and compressible fluid dynamics.",AP,AP,1,0

2503.21899v1,Geometric regularity estimates for quasi-linear elliptic models in non-divergence form with strong absorption,Claudemir Alcantara; João Vitor da Silva; Ginaldo Sá,"In this manuscript, we investigate geometric regularity estimates for problems governed by quasi-linear elliptic models in non-divergence form, which may exhibit either degenerate or singular behavior when the gradient vanishes, under strong absorption conditions of the form: \[ |\nabla u(x)|^{\gamma} \Delta_p^{\mathrm{N}} u(x) = f(x, u) \quad \text{in} \quad B_1, \] where $\gamma > -1$, $p \in (1, \infty)$, and the mapping $u \mapsto f(x, u) \lesssim \mathfrak{a}(x) u_{+}^m$ (with $m \in [0, \gamma + 1)$) does not decay sufficiently fast at the origin. This condition allows for the emergence of plateau regions, i.e., a priori unknown subsets where the non-negative solution vanishes identically. We establish improved geometric $\mathrm{C}^\kappa_{\text{loc}}$ regularity along the set $\mathscr{F}_0 = \partial \{u > 0\} \cap B_1$ (the free boundary of the model) for a sharp value of $\kappa \gg 1$, which is explicitly determined in terms of the structural parameters.

We provide a complete characterization of existence and uniqueness for normalized solutions and for energy ground states for every value of the nonlinearity powers.

Here we consider a scenario in which two species are dominant and one species is vanishingly small. In this scenario two energy levels are distinguished: the zeroth-order energy encodes information on the optimal arrangement of the dominant constituents, while the first-order energy gives the shape of the vanishing constituent. This first-order energy also shows that, for any optimal configuration, the vanishing phase must lie on the boundary between the two dominant constituents and form lens clusters also known as vesica piscis.",AP,AP,1,0

2503.21625v1,On the reverse isoperimetric inequality in Gauss space,Friedemann Brock; Francesco Chiacchio,"In this paper we investigate the reverse isoperimetric inequality with respect to the Gaussian measure for convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. While the isoperimetric problem for the Gaussian measure is well understood, many relevant aspects of the reverse problem have not yet been investigated. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, there seem to be no results on the shape that the isoperimetric set should take. Here, through a local perturbation analysis, we show that smooth perimeter-maximizing sets have locally flat boundaries. Additionally, we derive sharper perimeter bounds than those previously known, particularly for specific classes of convex sets such as the convex sets symmetric with respect to the axes. Finally, for quadrilaterals with vertices on the coordinate axes, we prove that the set maximizing the perimeter ""degenerates"" into the x-axis, traversed twice.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.21604v1,On the dynamics of leapfrogging vortex rings,Martin Donati; Lars Eric Hientzsch; Christophe Lacave; Evelyne Miot,"The evolution of highly concentrated vorticity around rings in the three-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations is studied in a regime for which the leapfrogging dynamics predicted by Helmholtz is expected to occur. For a general class of initial data corresponding to vortex rings of sufficiently small thickness $\varepsilon>0$, we prove weak and strong localization estimates for the vortex rings at positive times up to some time $T_0/|\ln \varepsilon|$ for fixed $T_0$, independent of $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we derive the motion law for the position of the rings on $[0,T_0/|\ln \varepsilon|]$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of a rigorous derivation of the leapfrogging motion up to times of order $|\ln\varepsilon|^{-1}$ for general initial data and the suitable scaling regime. The singular interaction of rings requires significant improvements of weak and strong localization estimates obtained in prior works. Our method is based on the combination of a new variational argument and a recently introduced double iterative procedure. Possibly due to natural filamentation of the vortex rings, which induces a lack of control of the support of the solution in the symmetry axis direction, our method does not allow to reach the time at which the rings have performed a full rotation around each other.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.21580v1,Global higher integrability and Hardy inequalities for double-phase functionals under a capacity density condition,Fabian Bäuerlein; Samuele Riccò; Leah Schätzler,"We prove global higher integrability for functionals of double-phase type under a uniform local capacity density condition on the complement of the considered domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. In this context, we investigate a new natural notion of variational capacity associated to the double-phase integrand. Under the related fatness condition for the complement of $\Omega$, we establish an integral Hardy inequality. Further, we show that fatness of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \Omega$ is equivalent to a boundary Poincar\'e inequality, a pointwise Hardy inequality and to the local uniform $p$-fatness of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \Omega$. We provide a counterexample that shows that the expected Maz'ya type inequality - a key intermediate step toward global higher integrability - does not hold with the notion of capacity involving the double-phase functional itself.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.21572v2,Convergence of a Stochastic Particle System to the Continuous Generalized Exchange-Driven Growth Model,Chun Yin Lam; André Schlichting,"The continuous generalized exchange-driven growth model (CGEDG) is a system of integro-differential equations describing the evolution of cluster mass under mass exchange. The rate of exchange depends on the masses of the clusters involved and the mass being exchanged. This can be viewed as both a continuous generalization of the exchange-driven growth model and a coagulation-fragmentation equation that generalizes the continuous Smoluchowski equation.   Starting from a Markov jump process that describes a finite stochastic interacting particle system with exchange dynamics, we prove the weak law of large numbers for this process for sublinearly growing kernels in the mean-field limit. We establish the tightness of the stochastic process on a measure-valued Skorokhod space induced by the $1$-Wasserstein metric, from which we deduce the existence of solutions to the (CGEDG) system. The solution is shown to have a Lebesgue density under suitable assumptions on the initial data.

The nonlinear stability of these periodic waves is established in the setting of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, which is a well-known reaction-diffusion model with degenerate diffusion. First, for general systems, we give the expressions of spectra with small modulus for linearized operators about these periodic waves via the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and the Lin-Sandstede method. Second, applying these spectral results to the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, we establish their diffusive spectral stability.

This error bound is called the relativistic effect in quantum mechanics. We confirm that the relativistic effect in the Dirac--Fock ground-state energy is of the order $\cO(c^{-2})$ with $c$ being the speed of light. Furthermore, if the potential between electrons and nuclei is regular, we get the leading order relativistic correction, which comprises the sum of the mass-velocity term, the Darwin term, and the spin-orbit term. The proof is based on a delicate study of projections onto the positive eigenspace of some Dirac operators.   To our knowledge, it is the first mathematical derivation of the leading order relativistic correction for nonlinear Dirac ground-state energies. Our method paves the way to study the relativistic effects in general nonlinear Dirac problems.",AP,AP,1,0

2503.21245v1,Global Stable Solutions to the Free Boundary Allen--Cahn and Bernoulli Problems in 3D are One-Dimensional,Hardy Chan; Xavier Fernández-Real; Alessio Figalli; Joaquim Serra,"A long-standing conjecture of De Giorgi asserts that every monotone solution of the Allen--Cahn equation in \(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\) is one-dimensional if \(n \leq 7\). A stronger version of the conjecture, also widely studied and often called ``the stable De Giorgi conjecture'', proposes that every stable solution in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) must be one-dimensional for \(n \leq 7\). To this date, both conjectures remain open for \(3 \leq n \leq 7\).   An elegant variant of this problem, advocated by Caffarelli, C\'ordoba, and Jerison since the 1990s, considers a free boundary version of the Allen--Cahn equation. This variant features a step-like double-well potential, leading to multiple free boundaries. Locally, near each free boundary, the solution satisfies the Bernoulli free boundary problem. However, the interaction of the free boundaries causes the global behavior of the solution to resemble that of the Allen--Cahn equation.   In this paper, we establish the validity of the stable De Giorgi conjecture in dimension 3 for the free boundary Allen--Cahn equation and, as a corollary, we prove the corresponding De Giorgi conjecture for monotone solutions in dimension 4. To obtain these results, a key aspect of our work is to address a classical open problem in free boundary theory of independent interest: the classification of global stable solutions to the one-phase Bernoulli problem in three dimensions. This result, which is the core of our paper, implies universal curvature estimates for local stable solutions to Bernoulli, and serves as a foundation for adapting some classical ideas from minimal surface theory -- after significant refinements -- to the free boundary Allen--Cahn equation.",AP,AP,1,0

Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce the quasi-periodic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map and an auxiliary sesquilinear form to characterize the subwavelength resonant frequencies, which are identified through the condition that the determinant of a certain matrix vanishes. Second, we derive asymptotic expansions for these resonant frequencies and the corresponding non-trivial solutions, thereby establishing the existence of subwavelength phononic bandgaps in elastic media. Finally, we analyze dilute structures in three dimensions, where the spacing between adjacent resonators is significantly larger than the characteristic size of an individual resonator, allowing the inter-resonator interactions to be neglected. In particular, an illustrative example is presented in which the resonator is modeled as a ball.",AP,AP,1,0

This study is motivated by disease control strategies, such as quarantine and lockdown, that limit population movement. We examine two scenarios: one where the movement of the susceptible population is restricted, and another where the movement of the infected population is neglected. We establish the long-term dynamics of the solutions in each scenario. Compared to previous studies that assume the absence of a saturated incidence function (i.e., $m\equiv 0$), our findings highlight the novel and significant interplay between total population size, transmission risk level, and the saturated incidence function in influencing disease persistence, extinction, and spatial distribution. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical results, and the implications of the results are discussed in the context of disease control and eradication strategies.",AP,AP,1,0

2503.20922v1,A kinetic theory approach to consensus formation in financial markets,Jean-Gabriel Attali; Francesco Salvarani,"We investigate the relationship between analysts' one-year consensus forecasts for the S&P 500 index and its current level. Contrary to the conventional view that sentiment drives price forecasts, our analysis predicts that the average consensus has no effect on forecasts, while the current S&P 500 index level alone is sufficient to anticipate analysts' price expectations.   Employing a kinetic theory framework, we model the dynamics of analysts' opinions, by taking into account both the mutual influences shaping price consensus and the dynamics of the actual S&P 500 index level. Testing the model on real data on a long-time series of data shows that just three free parameters are enough to accurately describe the one-year average price forecasts of analysts.",AP,AP,1,0

2503.20747v1,Elliptic boundary-value problems in some distribution spaces of generalized smoothness,Anna Anop; Aleksandr Murach,We build a solvability theory of elliptic boundary-value problems in normed Sobolev spaces of generalized smoothness for any integral-exponent $p>1$. The smoothness is given by a number parameter and a supplementary function parameter that varies slowly at infinity. These spaces are obtained by a combination of the methods of the complex interpolation with number parameter between Banach spaces and the quadratic interpolation with function parameter between Hilbert spaces applied to classical Sobolev spaces. We show that the spaces under study admit localization near a smooth boundary and describe their trace spaces in terms of Besov spaces with the same supplementary function parameter. We prove that a general differential elliptic problem induces Fredholm bounded operators on appropriate pairs of the spaces under study. We also find exact sufficient conditions for solutions of the problem to have a prescribed generalized or classical smoothness on a given set and establish corresponding a priory estimates of the solution. These results are specified for parameter-elliptic problems.,AP,AP,1,0

This allows us to prove that the approximate energies $\Gamma$-converge to their sharp interface counterpart.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.20480v1,On the decay of mass with respect to an invariant measure for semilinear heat equations in exterior domains,Ahmad Fino; Motohiro Sobajima,"The paper concerns with the decay property of solutions to the initial-boundary value problem of the semilinear heat equation $\partial_tu-\Delta u+u^p=0$ in exterior domains $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 2$). The problem for the one-dimensional case is formulated with $\Omega=(0,\infty)$ which is one of the representative of the connected components in $\mathbb{R}$. One can see that the $C_0$-semigroup for the corresponding linear problem possesses an invariant measure $\phi(x)\,dx$, where $\phi$ is a positive harmonic function satisfying the Dirichlet boundary condition. This paper clarifies that the mass of solutions with respect to the measure $\phi(x)\,dx$ vanishes as $t\to \infty$ if and only if $1<p\leq \min\{2,1+\frac{2}{N}\}$. In the other case $p>\min\{2,1+\frac{2}{N}\}$, we prove that all solutions are asymptotically free. The asymptotic profile is actually given by a modification with Gaussian when $N\geq 3$.",AP,AP,1,0

In the present paper we improve on the $t$-independence condition by introducing a mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ condition that only depends on $\partial_t A$, the derivative of $A$ in transversal direction. This condition is different from other conditions in the literature and has already been proven to imply solvability of the Dirichlet boundary value problem.",AP,AP,1,0

After reviewing the different notions of persistence and spreading speeds, we focus on the effect of the direction of the advection term, denoted by $b$. First, we prove that changing $b$ to $-b$ can have an effect on the spreading speeds and the ability of persistence. Next, we provide a class of relationships between the intrinsic growth term $r$ and the advection term $b$ such that changing $b$ to $-b$ does not change the spreading speeds and the ability of persistence. We briefly mention the cases of slowly and rapidly varying environments, and bounded domains. Lastly, we show that in general, the spreading speeds are not controlled by the ability of persistence, and conversely. However, when there is no advection term, the spreading speeds are controlled by the ability of persistence, though the converse still does not hold.",AP,AP,1,0

However, we demonstrate that reverse Sobolev inequalities of order $\gamma\in(\frac{n}{2},\frac{n}{2}+1)$ on the $n$-sphere can be readily derived from the reversed HLS inequalities. For the case $\gamma\in(\frac{n}{2}+1,\frac{n}{2}+2)$, we present a simple proof of reverse Sobolev inequalities by using the center of mass condition introduced by Hang. In addition, applying this approach, we establish the quantitative stability of reverse Sobolev inequalities of order $\gamma\in(\frac{n}{2}+1,\frac{n}{2}+2)$ with explicit lower bounds. Finally, by using conformally covariant boundary operators and reverse Sobolev inequalities, we derive Sobolev trace inequalities on the unit ball.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.20343v1,Maximal turbulence as a selection criterion for measure-valued solutions,Christian Klingenberg; Simon Markfelder; Emil Wiedemann,"The quest for a good solution concept for the partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in mathematical fluid dynamics is an outstanding open problem. An important notion of solutions are the measure-valued solutions. It is well known that for many PDEs there exists a multitude of measure-valued solutions even if admissibility criteria like an energy inequality are imposed. Hence in recent years, people have tried to select the relevant solutions among all admissible measure-valued solutions or at least to rule out some solutions which are not relevant.   In this paper another such criterion is studied. In particular, we aim to select generalized Young measures which are ``maximally turbulent''. To this end, we look for maximizers of a certain functional, namely the variance, or more precisely, the Jensen defect of the energy. We prove existence of such a maximizer and we show that its mean value and total energy is uniquely determined. Our theory is carried out in a very general setting which may be applied in many situations where maximally turbulent measures shall be selected among a set of generalized Young measures.   Finally, we apply this general framework to the incompressible and the isentropic compressible Euler equation. Our criterion of maximal turbulence is plausible and leads to existence and uniqueness in a certain sense (in particular, the mean value and the total energy of different maximally turbulent solutions coincide).",AP,AP,1,0
2503.20300v1,Mass concentration of minimizers for $L^2$-subcritical Kirchhoff energy functional in bounded domains,Chen Yang; Shubin Yu; Chun-Lei Tang,"We are concerned with $L^2$-constraint minimizers for the Kirchhoff functional $$ E_b(u)=\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^2\mathrm{d}x+\frac{b}{2}\left(\int_\Omega|\nabla u|^2\mathrm{d}x\right)^2+\int_\Omega V(x)u^2\mathrm{d}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\int_{\Omega}|u|^4\mathrm{d}x, $$ where $b>0$, $\beta>0$ and $V(x)$ is a trapping potential in a bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb R^2$. As is well known that minimizers exist for any $b>0$ and $\beta>0$, while the minimizers do not exist for $b=0$ and $\beta\geq\beta^*$, where $\beta^*=\int_{\mathbb R^2}|Q|^2\mathrm{d}x$ and $Q$ is the unique positive solution of $-\Delta u+u-u^3=0$ in $\mathbb R^2$. In this paper, we show that for $\beta=\beta^*$, the energy converges to 0, but for $\beta>\beta^*$, the minimal energy will diverge to $-\infty$ as $b\searrow0$. Further, we give the refined limit behaviors and energy estimates of minimizers as $b\searrow0$ for $\beta=\beta^*$ or $\beta>\beta^*$. For both cases, we obtain that the mass of minimizers concentrates either at an inner point or near the boundary of $\Omega$, depending on whether $V(x)$ attains its flattest global minimum at an inner point of $\Omega$ or not. Meanwhile, we find an interesting phenomenon that the blow-up rate when the minimizers concentrate near the boundary of $\Omega$ is faster than concentration at an interior point if $\beta=\beta^*$, but the blow-up rates remain consistent if $\beta>\beta^*$.",AP,AP,1,0

Due to the degeneracy of the Taylor-Couette flow at infinity, we cannot expect the solution to decay exponentially in a space-time decoupled manner. As stated in previous work \cite{LZZ-25}, even space-time coupled exponential decay can not be expected, and at most, we can obtain space-time coupled polynomial decay. To handle the space-time coupled decay multiplier, the previous time-independent resolvent estimate methods no longer work. Therefore, this paper introduces time-dependent resolvent estimates to deal with the space-time coupled decay multiplier $\Lambda_k$. We remark that the choice of $\Lambda_k$ is not unique, here we just provide one way to construct it. Finally, as an application, we derive a transition threshold bound of $\frac12$, which is the same as that for the Taylor-Couette flow in the bounded region.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.20109v1,Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach,Semsi Coskun; Davood Damircheli; Robert Lipton,"A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.",AP,AP,1,0

Modeling and simulation can be used to analyze such complex energy networks. In this paper, we performed discretization on the underlying partial differential equations of a pipeline and identified the complete network model for the gas, water and power distribution network. The discretized network model can be represented in a unified state-space form, that is, a specific matrix vector form for a set of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Due to the size and complexity of these models, their simulation can be computationally expensive. To address this issue, we applied model order reduction to the original unified mathematical model, constructing a reduced-order model that approximates the behavior of the original model with minimal computational cost. Specifically, we utilize the tangential iterative rational Krylov algorithm (tIRKA) which ensure that the interpolation condition of the linear part of the original and the reduced nonlinear unified models are interpolating along the predefined tangent directions.

The proof employs refined commutator estimates for the fractional Laplacian together with new energy methods that exploit this logarithmic improvement to prevent singularity formation.   Furthermore, we establish links between these improved criteria and turbulence theory. We derive precise relationships connecting the regularity conditions with turbulent intermittency, showing that the logarithmic enhancements correspond to anomalous scaling exponents in the turbulent energy spectrum. Additionally, we characterize the local structure of potential singularities and provide tight bounds on the energy flux in turbulent cascades. This approach bridges the gap between subcritical and critical regularity for the Navier--Stokes equations and offers a robust mathematical foundation for key phenomena observed in turbulence.",AP,AP,1,0

In this paper, we provide a general treatment of the asymptotics of quantization on metric measure spaces $(X, \nu)$.

2503.17874v1,Extension theory via boundary triplets for infinite-dimensional implicit port-Hamiltonian systems,Hannes Gernandt; Friedrich Philipp; Till Preuster; Manuel Schaller,"The solution of constrained linear partial-differential equations can be described via parametric representations of linear relations. To study these representations, we provide a novel definition of boundary triplets for linear relations in range representations where the associated boundary map is defined on the domain of the parameterizing operators rather than the relation itself. This allows us to characterize all boundary conditions such that the underlying dynamics is represented by a self-adjoint, skew-adjoint or maximally dissipative relation. The theoretical results are applied to a class of implicit port-Hamiltonian systems on one-dimensional spatial domains. More precisely, we explicitly construct a boundary triplet which solely depends on the coefficient matrices of the involved matrix differential operators and we derive the associated Lagrangian subspace. We exemplify our approach by means of the Dzektser equation, the biharmonic wave equation, and an elastic rod with non-local elasticity condition.",AP,AP,1,0

The primary objective is to address the inverse problem of recovering the elastic moduli of the inhomogeneity using a limited number of incident fields. In the static case, we adopt an efficient reformulation of Eshelby's equation proposed by Bonnet [7]. By employing a first-order approximation in addition with a limited number of incident loadings and measurements, we numerically determine the material coefficients of the inclusion. In elastodynamics, we focus on the inverse scattering problem, utilizing the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation to reconstruct the elastic properties of the inclusion through a Newton-type iterative scheme.

We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for these properties and examine their connections with classical notions of global hypoellipticity and solvability, particularly in relation to the closedness of the operator's range.   As an application, we explore the interplay between these properties and number theory in the context of differential operators on the two-torus. Specifically, we prove that the loss of derivatives in the solvability of the vector field $\partial_{x_1} - \alpha \partial_{x_2}$ is precisely determined by the well-known irrationality measure $\mu(\alpha)$ of its coefficient $\alpha$. Furthermore, we analyze the wave operator $\partial_{x_1}^2 - \eta^2 \Delta_{\mathbb{T}^n}$ and show how the loss of derivatives depends explicitly on the parameter $\eta > 0$.",AP,AP,1,0

The control variables, representing chemotherapy and a lactate-targeting drug, influence tumor progression and treatment response. Starting from well-posedness, regularity, and continuous dependence results already established, we define a suitable cost functional and prove the existence of optimal controls. Then, we analyze the differentiability of the control-to-state operator and establish a necessary first-order condition for treatment optimality.",AP,AP,1,0

Existence of energetic solutions, based on global minimisers of a suitable functional together with an energy balance, is obtained within the natural class of open sets, improving and simplifying previous results known in literature. The proposed approach relies on an equivalent reformulation of the model in terms of the celebrated one-phase Bernoulli free boundary problem. This point of view allows performing the Minimizing Movements scheme in spaces of functions instead of the more complicated framework of sets. Nevertheless, in order to encompass irreversibility of the phenomenon, it remains crucial to keep track of the debonded region at each discrete time-step, thus actually resulting in a coupled algorithm.",AP,AP,1,0

We aim to prove that a spatial gradient is continuous in space and time. An external force term is treated under the optimal regularity assumption in the parabolic Lebesgue spaces. We also discuss a generalized parabolic system with the Uhlenbeck structure. A main difficulty is that the uniform ellipticity of the $(1,\,p)$-Laplace operator is violated on a facet, or the degenerate region of a spatial gradient. The gradient continuity is proved by showing local H\""{o}lder continuity of a truncated gradient, whose support is far from the facet. This is rigorously demonstrated by considering approximate parabolic systems and deducing various regularity estimates for approximate solutions by classical methods such as De Giorgi's truncation, Moser's iteration, and freezing coefficient arguments. A weak maximum principle is also utilized when $p$ is not in the supercritical range.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.16758v1,Nonlinear stability of compressible vortex sheets in three-dimensional elastodynamics,Robin Ming Chen; Feimin Huang; Dehua Wang; Difan Yuan,"We investigate the nonlinear stability of compressible vortex sheet solutions for three-dimensional (3D) isentropic elastic flows. Building upon previous results on the weakly linear stability of elastic vortex sheets [19], we perform a detailed study of the roots of the Lopatinskii determinant and identify a geometric stability condition associated with the deformation gradient. We employ an upper triangularization technique that isolates the outgoing modes into a closed system, where they appear only at the leading order. This enables us to derive energy estimates despite derivative loss. The major novelty of our approach includes the following two key aspects: (1) For the 3D compressible Euler vortex sheets, the front symbol exhibits degenerate ellipticity in certain frequency directions, which makes it challenging to ensure the front's regularity using standard energy estimates. Our analysis reveals that the non-parallel structure of the deformation gradient tensor plays a crucial role in recovering ellipticity in the front symbol, thereby enhancing the regularity of the free interface. (2) Another significant challenge in 3D arises from the strong degeneracy caused by the collision of repeated roots and poles. Unlike in 2D, where such interactions are absent, we encounter a co-dimension one set in frequency space where a double root coincides with a double pole. To resolve this, we refine Coulombel's diagonalization framework [21] and construct a suitable transformation that reduces the degeneracy order of the Lopatinskii matrix, enabling the use of localized Garding-type estimates to control the characteristic components. Finally, we employ a Nash-Moser iteration scheme to establish the local existence and nonlinear stability of vortex sheets under small initial perturbations, showing stability within a subsonic regime.",AP,AP,1,0

In particular, for symmetric decreasing initial data, the solution to the advection-diffusion equation has (without a prefactor constant) larger variance, larger entropy, and smaller $L^p$ norms for all $p \in [1,\infty]$ than the solution to the heat equation. We also note that the same is not true on $\mathbb{T}^d$.",AP,AP,1,0

Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi--Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi--Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi--Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose--type blow--ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi--Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow--up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\""ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi--Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\""ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi--Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.",AP,AP,1,0

This aligns with the stabilizing effect of multiplicative noise in partial differential equations. Utilizing the linearized system, we can quantify the magnitude of noise which stabilizes the system. On the other hand, when the noise is involving only one concentration, then the Turing instability can be triggered with suitable intensities. These are confirmed by numerical simulations.",AP,AP,1,0

In this limit, we recover the Yudovich solution of the incompressible Euler equations.   We prove that the vorticity convergence holds in $L^\infty_t L^p_x$, for any finite integrability exponent $p<\infty$. This extends to the case $p=\infty$ provided that the initial vorticities are continuous and converge uniformly. We also discuss the sharpness of this limit by demonstrating that the continuity assumption on the initial data is necessary for the endpoint convergence in $L^\infty_{t,x}$.   The proof of the strong convergence relies on the {\em Extrapolation Compactness} method, recently introduced by Ars\'enio and the first author to address similar stability questions for the Euler equations. The approach begins with establishing the convergence in a lower regularity space, at first. Then, in a later step, the convergence to Yudovich's vorticity of Euler equations in Lebesgue spaces comes as a consequence of a careful analysis of the evanescence of specific high Fourier modes of the QGSW vorticity. A central challenge arises from the absence of a velocity formulation for QGSW, which we overcome by employing advanced tools from Littlewood Paley theory in endpoint settings.   The sharpness of the convergence in the endpoint $L^\infty_{t,x}$ case is obtained in the context of vortex patches, drawing insights from key findings on uniformly rotating and stationary solutions of active scalar equations.",AP,AP,1,0

Furthermore, a high resolution form of the method is proposed that limits a priori the second order accurate scheme towards first order accuracy to keep the values of numerical solutions in a physically acceptable range.   Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of high resolution methods in minimizing oscillations near discontinuities, thereby enhancing solution plausibility. The observed convergence rates confirm that the second order accurate schemes achieve expected accuracy for smooth solutions and that they yield significant improvements when compared with the results of the first order scheme. As the computational cost of the compact implicit method seems to be comparable to similar explicit ones with a clear profit of unconditional stability, this research provides a practical tool toward numerical simulations of nonlinear transport phenomena applicable in various fields such as contaminant transport in porous media or column liquid chromatography.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

First, we show that $\mathcal{T}$ acts as an isometry on this set, and then we characterize $\Omega(\mathcal{T})$ as the set of global viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, i.e. solutions that are defined for all real times.   Next, we introduce a generalized Peierls barrier $\underline{k}$ and a set of generalized static classes $\underline{\mathbb{M}}$ within the Mather set.

The objective is to determine the unknown function $f(t)$ (Inverse Problem 1) and $h(x)$ (Inverse Problem 2), given that the other function is known.   For Inverse Problem 1, we impose an overdetermination condition in the form of a spatial integral over the domain $\Omega $, involving the solution of the corresponding direct problem an initial-boundary value problem with standard Cauchy conditions and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The integral is weighted by the known spatial factor h(x) from the right-hand side of the equation. This choice of an additional condition enables the explicit construction of a solution to the inverse problem and allows us to prove its unique solvability within the class of regular solutions. To study the direct problem, the regular solution approach is used.   For Inverse Problem 2, we introduce a novel integral-type additional condition, referred to as the time-averaged velocity, incorporating an appropriate weight function.

Depending on its choice, the additional condition reduces to specifying either the final-time offset or the time-averaged offset. Under this formulation, we establish a new uniqueness result.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.15839v1,Structural stability of cylindrical supersonic solutions to the steady Euler-Poisson system,Chunpeng Wang; Zihao Zhang,"This paper concerns the structural stability of smooth cylindrically symmetric supersonic Euler-Poisson flows in nozzles. Both three-dimensional and axisymmetric perturbations are considered. On one hand, we establish the existence and uniqueness of three-dimensional smooth supersonic solutions to the potential flow model of the steady Euler-Poisson system. On the other hand, the existence and uniqueness of smooth supersonic flows with nonzero vorticity to the steady axisymmetric Euler-Poisson system are proved. The problem is reduced to solve a nonlinear boundary value problem for a hyperbolic-elliptic mixed system. One of the key ingredients in the analysis of three-dimensional supersonic irrotational flows is the well-posedness theory for a linear second order hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system, which is achieved by using the multiplier method and the reflection technique to derive the energy estimates. For smooth axisymmetric supersonic flows with nonzero vorticity, the deformation-curl-Poisson decomposition is utilized to reformulate the steady axisymmetric Euler-Poisson system as a deformation-curl-Poisson system together with several transport equations, so that one can design a two-layer iteration scheme to establish the nonlinear structural stability of the background supersonic flow within the class of axisymmetric rotational flows.",AP,AP,1,0

The well-posedness problem is formulated as a free boundary problem, where initial discontinuities propagate along linearly degenerate characteristics. By mollifying initial data in Lagrangian coordinates, the problem is reduced to analyzing the limit of classical solutions. To avoid equation degeneracy due to vacuum states, we establish a uniform lower bound for density by categorizing discontinuity types at singular points. Using level sets for velocity derivatives, we derive uniform estimates for density and velocity gradients. Through equivalence of coordinate transformations, the well-posedness of contact discontinuity solutions in original coordinates is rigorously proven. Results show that compressive initial data induce finite-time singularity formation, while rarefactive initial data ensure global existence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that solutions of the Aw-Rascle model converge to those of the pressureless model under vanishing pressure, with matching convergence rates for velocity and characteristic triangles. By enhancing regularity in non-discontinuous regions, we prove convergence of the Aw-Rascle model's blow-up time to the pressureless model's blow-up time.

The best constant in this estimate involves the asymptotic volume ratio, and its optimality is obtained by means of the sharp $L^2$-logarithmic Sobolev inequality on ${\sf RCD}(0,N)$ spaces. If equality holds in this sharp estimate for a prescribed time $t_0>0$ and a non-zero extremizer $f$, it turns out that the ${\sf RCD}(0,N)$ space has an $N$-Euclidean cone structure and ${\sf H}_{t_0}f$ is a Gaussian whose dilation factor is reciprocal to $t_0$ up to a multiplicative constant.

A classical result establishes that for a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with a Lipschitz boundary and for $f \in L^p(\Omega)$ with zero mean value there exists a solution $\mathbf{u} \in (W_0^{1, p}(\Omega))^N$ for $1 < p < \infty$ with the $W^{1,p}$ norm controlled by the $L^p$ norm of the right-hand side $f$. The results were extended to John domains and excluded the existence of the solution operator in domains with external cusps. Our aim is to specify at least some classes of the right-hand sides for which the problem cannot have a solution in the space $W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$. We first extend the counterexample by Luc Tartar originally formulated for right-hand side functions in $\overline{L^2}$ in two space dimensions to a more general class of functions in $\overline{L^p}$ spaces and a more general type of singular domains.

We characterize the $\Gamma$-limit of the energies as the total variation of this measure.

This approach is based on the semiclassical approximation and the principles of the Maslov method. The fractal time derivative is introduced in the framework of $F^{\alpha}$-calculus. The Fisher--KPP equation is decomposed into a system of nonlinear equations that describe the dynamics of interacting quasiparticles within classes of trajectory-concentrated functions. A key element in constructing approximate quasiparticle solutions is the interplay between the dynamical system of quasiparticle moments and an auxiliary linear system of equations, which is coupled with the nonlinear system. General constructions are illustrated through examples that examine the effect of the fractal parameter $\alpha$ on quasiparticle behavior.",AP,AP,1,0

The evolution problem is well-defined in the function space $H^1_{\rm per} \cap W^{1,\infty}$, where we derive the linearized equations of motion and study the nonlinear evolution of co-periodic perturbations to the peaked periodic wave by using methods of characteristics. Within the linearized equations, we prove the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave from the spectrum of the linearized operator in a Hilbert space, which completely covers the closed vertical strip with a specific half-width. Within the nonlinear equations, we prove the nonlinear instability of the peaked traveling wave by showing that the gradient of perturbations grow at the wave peak. By using numerical approximations of the smooth traveling waves and the spectrum of their associated linearized operator, we show that the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave cannot be obtained in the limit along the family of the spectrally stable smooth traveling waves.",AP,AP,1,0

The binding process can be modeled by an additive random functional corresponding to the canonical construction of a `killed' diffusion Markov process. We study the problem of conducting inference on the infinite-dimensional diffusion parameter from a histogram plot of the `killing' positions of the process. We show first that these positions follow a Poisson point process whose intensity measure is determined by the solution of a certain Schr\""odinger equation. The inference problem can then be re-cast as a non-linear inverse problem for this PDE, which we show to be consistently solvable in a Bayesian way under natural conditions on the initial state of the diffusion, provided the binding potential is not too `aggressive'. In the course of our proofs we obtain novel posterior contraction rate results for high-dimensional Poisson count data that are of independent interest.

Lo; Shen Zhang,"In this book, we present a curated collection of existing results on inverse problems for Mean Field Games (MFGs), a cutting-edge and rapidly evolving field of research. Our aim is to provide fresh insights, novel perspectives, and a comprehensive foundation for future investigations into this fascinating area. MFGs, a class of differential games involving a continuum of non-atomic players, offer a powerful framework for analyzing the collective behavior of large populations of symmetric agents as the number of agents approaches infinity. This framework has proven to be an invaluable tool for quantitatively modeling the macroscopic dynamics of agents striving to minimize specific costs in complex systems, such as crowd dynamics, financial markets, traffic flows, and social networks.   The study of MFGs has traditionally focused on forward problems, where the goal is to determine the equilibrium behavior of agents given a set of model parameters, such as cost functions, interaction mechanisms, and initial conditions. However, the inverse problems for MFGs -- which seek to infer these underlying parameters from observed data -- have received comparatively less attention in the literature. This book seeks to address this gap by delving into the fundamental aspects of MFG inverse problems, with a particular emphasis on issues of unique identifiability, stability, and reconstruction of unknown parameters. These problems are not only mathematically challenging but also of immense practical significance, as they enable the calibration and validation of MFG models using real-world data.   This book is intended to serve as a valuable resource for researchers interested in the theory and applications of MFGs, particularly in inverse problems.

The perturbed transonic shock are completely free and its strength and position are uniquely determined by the incoming flows and the exit pressure. A key issue in the analysis is the ``spherical projection coordinates"" (i.e. the composition of the spherical coordinates and the stereographic projection), which provides an appropriate setting for the spherical transonic shock problem in the sense that the transformed equations have a similar structure as the steady Euler equations and do not contain any coordinates singularities. Then we decompose the hyperbolic and elliptic modes in the steady Euler equations in terms of the deformation and vorticity. An elaborate reformulation of the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions yields an unusual second order differential boundary condition on the shock front to the first order nonlocal deformation-curl system, from which an oblique boundary condition can be derived after homogenizing the curl system and introducing the potential function. The analysis of the compatibility conditions at the intersection of the shock front and the shell boundary is crucial for the optimal regularity of all physical quantities.",AP,AP,1,0

Under a physically reasonable assumption on the curvature, solutions exist globally-in-time and asymptotically converge to rod equilibria.",AP,AP,1,0

Since the 1-jet and the 2-jet are stable, the main interest is the onset of instability for the 3-jet. We confirm long standing conjectures based on numerical simulations by proving that the 3-jet is linearly unstable if and only if the rotation rate belongs to a critical interval.

Our high-dimensional limiting technique is demonstrated through new proofs of three theorems for degenerate parabolic equations. Specifically, we establish the monotonicity of Almgren-type, Weiss-type, and Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman-type functionals in the degenerate parabolic setting. Each new parabolic proof in this article is based on a (new) related elliptic theorem and a careful limiting argument that is reminiscent of those from \cite{Dav18} and \cite{DSVG24}.

It then leaves the boundary either continuously (for the first type) or by a power-law distributed jump (for the second type). The construction of these processes is done via an It\^o synthesis: we concatenate their excursions in the domain, which are obtained by translating, rotating and stopping the excursions of some stable processes reflected in the half-space. The key ingredient in this procedure is the construction of the boundary processes, i.e. the processes time-changed by their local time on the boundary, which solve stochastic differential equations driven by some Poisson measures of excursions. The well-posedness of these boundary processes relies on delicate estimates involving some geometric inequalities and the laws of the undershoot and overshoot of the excursion when it leaves the domain.

The negativity of the coefficients leads to the lack of a priori bounds on the functionals; such issue is overcome by proving a nonlinear interpolation inequality. With this inequality at our disposal, a compactness result is achieved by resorting to the recent paper [10]. A further difficulty is the presence of general tensor norms which carry anisotropies, making standard slicing arguments not suitable.

This system is formulated as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric, the $\dot{H}^1$ -metric, which is closely related to the infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metric, and the derivative of an infinite-dimensional contact-type form as the magnetic field. We define Ma\~n\'e's critical value for exact magnetic systems on Hilbert manifolds in full generality and compute it explicitly for the (M2HS). Moreover, we establish an infinite-dimensional Hopf-Rinow theorem for this magnetic system, where Ma\~n\'e's critical value serves as the threshold beyond which the Hopf-Rinow theorem no longer holds. This geometric framework enables us to thoroughly analyze the blow-up behavior of solutions to the (M2HS). Using this insight, we extend solutions beyond blow-up by introducing and proving the existence of global conservative weak solutions. This extension is facilitated by extending the Madelung transform from an isometry into a magnetomorphism, embedding the magnetic system into a magnetic system on an infinite-dimensional sphere equipped with the derivative of the standard contact form as the magnetic field.

Even if global weak solutions for this system are known to exist, how to improve the regularity of weak solutions is a challenging problem due to the peculiar cubic nonlinearity and the possible elliptic singularity of the system. Global-in-time existence of classical solutions has recently been established showing that finite time singularities cannot emerge in this problem. However, whether or not singularities in infinite time can be precluded was still pending. In this work, we show that classical solutions of the initial-boundary value problem are uniformly bounded in time as long as $\gamma\geq1$ and $\kappa$ is suitably large, closing this gap in the literature. Moreover, uniqueness of classical solutions is also achieved based on the uniform-in-time bounds. Furthermore, it is shown that the corresponding stationary problem possesses a unique classical stationary solution which is semi-trivial, and that is globally exponentially stable, that is, all solutions of the time dependent problem converge exponentially fast to the semi-trivial steady state for $\kappa$ large enough.",AP,AP,1,0

The thickness of the thin insulating layer $\Sigma_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ is given locally via $\varepsilon h$, where $h\colon \Gamma_{I}\to [0,+\infty)$ specifies the (to be determined) distribution of the insulating material. We establish $\Gamma(L^2(\mathbb{R}^d))$-convergence of the problem (as $\varepsilon\to 0^+$). Different from the existing literature, which predominantly assumes that the thermally conducting body $\Omega$ has a $C^{1,1}$-boundary, we merely assume that $\Gamma_I$ is piece-wise flat. To overcome this lack of boundary regularity, we define the thin insulating boundary layer $\Sigma_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ using a Lipschitz continuous transversal vector field rather than the outward unit normal vector field. The piece-wise flatness condition on $\Gamma_I$ is only needed to prove the $\liminf$-estimate.

Many ribbons in nature have a non-trivial internal geometry, making them incompatible with the Euclidean space; this incompatibility, which can be represented as a failure of the Gauss-Codazzi equations for surfaces, often results in shape transitions between narrow and wide ribbons. These transitions depend on the internal geometry: ribbons whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Gauss equation always exhibit a transition, whereas some, but not all, of those whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Codazzi equations do. We give the first rigorous analysis of this behavior, mainly for ribbons whose first fundamental form is flat: for Gauss-incompatible ribbons we identify the natural energy scaling of the problem and prove the existence of a shape transition, and for Codazzi-incompatible ribbons we give a necessary condition for a transition to occur. The results are obtained by calculating the $\Gamma$-limits, as $t,w\to 0$, for narrow ribbons ($w^2 \ll t$), and wide ribbons (taking $t$ to zero and then $w$), in the natural energy scalings dictated by the internal geometry.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.11770v1,On the cutoff phenomenon for fast diffusion and porous medium equations,Djalil Chafaï; Max Fathi; Nikita Simonov,"The cutoff phenomenon, conceptualized at the origin for finite Markov chains, states that for a parametric family of evolution equations, started from a point, the distance towards a long time equilibrium may become more and more abrupt for certain choices of initial conditions, when the parameter tends to infinity. This threshold phenomenon can be seen as a critical competition between trend to equilibrium and worst initial condition. In this note, we investigate this phenomenon beyond stochastic processes, in the context of the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, by proving cutoff for the fast diffusion and porous medium Fokker-Planck equations on the Euclidean space, when the dimension tends to infinity. We formulate the phenomenon using quadratic Wasserstein distance, as well as using specific relative entropy and Fisher information.

In this work, we study a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion-aggregation system in which a population's spatiotemporal dynamics are tightly linked to a separate, dynamically updating map. Depending on the local population density, the map amplifies and suppresses certain landscape regions and contributes to directed movement through a nonlocal spatial kernel. After establishing the well-posedness of the coupled PDE-ODE system, we perform a linear stability analysis to identify critical aggregation strengths. We then perform a rigorous bifurcation analysis to determine the precise solution behavior at a steady state near these critical thresholds, deciding whether the bifurcation is sub- or supercritical and the stability of the emergent branch. Based on our analytical findings, we highlight several interesting biological consequences. First, we observe that whether the spatial map functions as attractive or repulsive depends precisely on the map's relative excitation rate versus adaptory rate: when the excitatory effect is larger (smaller) than the adaptatory effect, the map is attractive (repulsive). Second, in the absence of growth dynamics, populations can only form a single aggregate. Therefore, the presence of intraspecific competition is necessary to drive multi-peaked aggregations, reflecting higher-frequency spatial patterns. Finally, we show how subcritical bifurcations can trigger abrupt shifts in average population abundance, suggesting a tipping-point phenomenon in which moderate changes in movement parameters can cause a sudden population decline.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.11539v1,Travelling breather solutions in waveguides for cubic nonlinear Maxwell equations with retarded material laws,Sebastian Ohrem; Wolfgang Reichel,For Maxwell's equations with nonlinear polarization we prove the existence of time-periodic breather solutions travelling along slab or cylindrical waveguides. The solutions are TE-modes which are localized in space directions orthogonal to the direction of propagation. We assume a magnetically inactive and electrically nonlinear material law with a linear $\chi^{(1)}$- and a cubic $\chi^{(3)}$-contribution to the polarization. The $\chi^{(1)}$-contribution may be retarded in time or instantaneous whereas the $\chi^{(3)}$-contribution is always assumed to be retarded in time. We consider two different cubic nonlinearities which provide a variational structure under suitable assumptions on the retardation kernels. By choosing a sufficiently small propagation speed along the waveguide the second order formulation of the Maxwell system becomes essentially elliptic for the $\mathbf{E}$-field so that solutions can be constructed by the mountain pass theorem. The compactness issues arising in the variational method are overcome by either the cylindrical geometry itself or by extra assumptions on the linear and nonlinear parts of the polarization in case of the slab geometry. Our approach to breather solutions in the presence of time-retardation is systematic in the sense that we look for general conditions on the Fourier-coefficients in time of the retardation kernels. Our main existence result is complemented by concrete examples of coefficient functions and retardation kernels.,AP,AP,1,0

Based on this framework, we propose several second-order semi-discrete schemes that maintain linearity, computational decoupling, and unconditional energy stability. Firstly, for dissipative systems with known energy lower bounds, we introduce a positive auxiliary variable $V(t)$ to substitute the total energy functional, subsequently discretizing it on staggered temporal meshes to ensure that the energy remains non-increasing regardless of the size of time step. The newly developed schemes achieve full computational decoupling, maintaining essentially the same computational expense as conventional implicit-explicit methods while demonstrating significantly improved accuracy. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the positivity preservation of the discrete variable $V^{n+1/2}$ which is a crucial property ensuring numerical stability and accuracy. Theoretical analysis confirms second-order temporal convergence for the proposed SM schemes. Secondly, for dissipative systems lacking well-defined energy lower bounds, we devise an alternative auxiliary variable formulation and extend the SM framework to maintain unconditional energy stability while preserving numerical effectiveness and accuracy. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments, including benchmark problem simulations, validate the proposed schemes' efficacy and demonstrate their superior performance characteristics.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

When the trivial equilibrium is linearly unstable, we show that all pulsating traveling waves have a speed that is greater than the speed of the linearized system at the equilibrium, in any given direction. If moreover the nonlinearity is sublinear, then we can construct a pulsating traveling wave that travels at any super-linear speed in any given direction (i.e. the minimal speed is linearly determined). We also show that pulsating traveling waves are monotonic in time as soon as the nonlinearity is sub-homogeneous. Beyond these general qualitative properties, the main focus of the paper is to derive sufficient conditions for the existence and nonexistence of pulsating waves propagating in any given direction. Our proof of the existence part relies upon a new level of understanding of the multi-dimensional pulsating waves observed from a direction-dependent coordinate system.",AP,AP,1,0

The model is derived by coupling a non-local Cahn-Hilliard equation with a parabolic reaction-diffusion equation, which accounts for both phase segregation and nutrient diffusion. Previous studies have only considered symmetric potentials for similar models. However, in the biological context of cell-to-cell adhesion, single-well potentials, like the so-called Lennard-Jones potential, seem physically more appropriate. The Cahn-Hilliard equation with this kind of potential has already been analysed. Here, we take a step forward and consider a more refined model. First, we analyse the model with a viscous relaxation term in the chemical potential and subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions. We prove the existence of solutions, a separation property for the phase variable, and a continuous dependence estimate with respect to the initial data. Finally, via an asymptotic analysis, we recover the existence of a weak solution to the initial and boundary value problem without viscosity, provided that the chemotactic sensitivity is small enough.",AP,AP,1,0

We prove that this coupling error is asymptotically small for a certain class of data and discuss its role as a proxy for the full error with respect to the 3D water wave problem. Additionally, we highlight that this error can be easily computed in other scenarios.

This infinite dimensional PDE is nonlinear with respect to both the first and second-order derivatives of its solution. For standard mean field games with only drift control, it is well-known that certain monotonicity condition is essential for the uniqueness of mean field equilibria and for the global well-posedness of the master equations. To adapt to the current setting with volatility control, we propose a new notion called second-order monotonicity conditions. Surprisingly, the second-order Lasry-Lions monotonicity is equivalent to its standard (first-order) version, but such an equivalency fails for displacement monotonicity. When the Hamiltonian is separable and the data are Lasry-Lions monotone, we show that the Lasry-Lions monotonicity propagates and the master equation admits a unique classical solution. This is the first work for the well-posedness, both local and global, of master equations when the volatility is controlled.",AP,AP,1,0

Uniqueness of minimizer up to translation can still be guaranteed if the LIC radius is larger than the possible support size of any minimizer. Using this approach, we obtain uniqueness of minimizer for power-law potentials $W_{a,b}({\bf x}) = \frac{|{\bf x}|^a}{a} - \frac{|{\bf x}|^b}{b},\,-d<b<2$ with $a$ slightly smaller than 2 or slightly larger than 4. The estimate of LIC radius for $a$ slightly smaller than 2 is done via a Poincar\'{e}-type inequality for signed measures. To handle the case where $a$ slightly larger than 4, we truncate the attractive part of the potential at large radius and prove that the resulting potential has positive Fourier transform.

In space dimension $d=1$, we prove that the density function belongs to the Sobolev space $H^s(\mathbb R)$ for some $s>0$. In the case of pure states, we first obtain a characterization of the Wigner transform of rank-one quantum density operators, and apply this characterization (1) to analyze a rather general setting in which velocity averaging cannot apply to the Wigner functions of a family of rank-one density operators whose evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation, and (2) to obtain a quick derivation of Madelung's system of quantum hydrodynamic equations.

The novelty of this work, compared to previous studies, lies in considering a nonlocal nonlinearity $\|u(t)\|_{q}^\alpha |u|^p$ and a forcing term $t^{\varrho} \mathbf{w}(x)$ that depend on both time and space variables. This combination introduces new challenges in understanding the interplay between the nonlocal structure of the equation and the spatio-temporal forcing term.   Under appropriate assumptions, we establish the global existence of solutions for small initial data in Lebesgue spaces when the exponent $p$ exceeds a critical value. In contrast, we show that the global existence cannot hold for $p$ below this critical value, provided the additional condition $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \mathbf{w}(x) \, dx > 0$ is satisfied.

Low - order models have limitations in describing strong nonlinear and high - frequency dispersion effects. Thus, it is proposed to improve the modeling accuracy of water wave dynamics on long - time scales through high - order correction models. By making small - parameter corrections to the $abcd-$system, then performing approximate estimations, the fifth - order BBM equation is finally derived.For local well - posedness, the equation is first transformed into an equivalent integral equation form. With the help of multilinear estimates and the contraction mapping principle, it is proved that when $s\geq1$, for a given initial value $\eta_{0}\in H^{s}(\mathbb{R})$, the equation has a local solution $\eta \in C([0, T];H^{s})$, and the solution depends continuously on the initial value. Meanwhile, the maximum existence time of the solution and its growth restriction are given.For global well - posedness, when $s\geq2$, through energy estimates and local theory, combined with conservation laws, it is proved that the initial - value problem of the equation is globally well - posed in $H^{s}(\mathbb{R})$. When $1\leq s<2$, the initial value is decomposed into a rough small part and a smooth part, and evolution equations are established respectively. It is proved that the corresponding integral equation is locally well - posed in $H^{2}$ and the solution can be extended, thus concluding that the initial - value problem of the equation is globally well - posed in $H^{s}$.",AP,AP,1,0

Additionally, the relationship between $\rho_0$ and the potential function $f$ is constrained by the condition $\left(\partial_{y}\rho_{0}, \partial_{x}\rho_{0}\right)\cdot\left(\partial_{x}f,\partial_{y}f\right)=0$, which allows us to express $\nabla\rho_{0}$ as $h\left(x,y\right)\nabla f$. Second, when there exists a point $\left(x_{0},y_{0}\right)$ such that $h\left(x_{0},y_{0}\right)>0$, we establish the linear instability of these solutions.

By multistable, we mean that the problem admits a finite -- but arbitrarily large -- number of stable, periodic steady states. In contrast with the more classical monostable and bistable frameworks, which exhibit the emergence of a single travelling front in the long run, in the present case the large time dynamics is governed by a family of stacked travelling fronts, involving intermediate steady states, called propagating terrace. Their existence in the multidimensional case has been established in our previous work [13]. The first result of the present paper is their uniqueness. Next, we show that the speeds of the propagating terraces in different directions dictate the spreading speeds of solutions of the Cauchy problem, for both planar-like and compactly supported initial data. The latter case turns out to be much more intricate than the former, due to the fact that the propagating terraces in distinct directions may involve different sets of intermediate steady states. Another source of difficulty is that the Wulff shape of the speeds of travelling fronts can be non-smooth, as we show in the bistable case using a result of [4].",AP,AP,1,0

Despite extensive research on the numerical implementation of this method, no studies have yet explored the well-posedness of the integral invariant model itself. To address this gap, a weak solution theory for CSLDG is developed: A precise definition of the weak solution for the integral invariant model is formulated. Utilizing the slice method, which is frequently employed in existence proofs for parabolic equations, the existence of the weak solution is established through the application of the Riesz Representation Theorem and mollifier techniques.

Under some sufficient conditions on the anisotropic vanishing rates of the eigenvalues of the matrices of the viscous coefficients and the oscillatory parameter, we show that Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with no slip boundary condition converge to solutions of the Euler equations in the upper half space. To prove the result, we apply a change of variables to flatten the boundaries of the spatial domains for the Navier-Stokes equations, and then construct the boundary layer terms.

2503.06205v1,The initial-to-final-state inverse problem with time-independent potentials,Manuel Cañizares; Pedro Caro; Ioannis Parissis; Thanasis Zacharopoulos,"The initial-to-final-state inverse problem consists in determining a quantum Hamiltonian assuming the knowledge of the state of the system at some fixed time, for every initial state. This problem was formulated by Caro and Ruiz and motivated by the data-driven prediction problem in quantum mechanics. Caro and Ruiz analysed the question of uniqueness for Hamiltonians of the form $-\Delta + V$ with an electric potential $V = V(\mathrm{t}, \mathrm{x})$ that depends on the time and space variables. In this context, they proved that uniqueness holds in dimension $n \geq 2$ whenever the potentials are bounded and have super-exponential decay at infinity. Although their result does not seem to be optimal, one would expect at least some degree of exponential decay to be necessary for the potentials. However, in this paper, we show that by restricting the analysis to Hamiltonians with time-independent electric potentials, namely $V = V(\mathrm{x})$, uniqueness can be established for bounded integrable potentials exhibiting only super-linear decay at infinity, in any dimension $n \geq 2$. This surprising improvement is possible because, unlike Caro and Ruiz's approach, our argument avoids the use of complex geometrical optics (CGO). Instead, we rely on the construction of stationary states at different energies -- this is possible because the potential does not depend on time. These states will have an explicit leading term, given by a Herglotz wave, plus a correction term that will vanish as the energy grows. Besides the significant relaxation of decay assumptions on the potential, the avoidance of CGO solutions is important in its own right, since such solutions are not readily available in more complicated geometric settings.",AP,AP,1,0

It is proved that with such a strategy at the range edge the species can invade the environment successfully with all admissible initial populations, exhibiting the dynamics of super invaders. Numerical simulations are used to help understand what happens if the population density level at the range boundary is maintained at other levels.

Our theorem does not hold in the case of zero viscosity as this would violate the weak-strong uniqueness principle due to Lions.

As a continuation of a previous paper by Kanzler, Schmeiser, and Tora [KRM, 2024], a model for higher order non-instantaneous alignment collisions is presented and studied in the asymptotic regime of short collision duration. A first order accurate approximative model is derived as a correction to the instantaneous limit. Rigorous results on its well-posedness and on the instantaneous limit are proven. The approximative model is a system of two equations. The possibility of finding an equally accurate scalar approximation is discussed.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.05503v1,Steady bubbles and drops in inviscid fluids,David Meyer; Lukas Niebel; Christian Seis,"We construct steady non-spherical bubbles and drops, which are traveling wave solutions to the axisymmetric two-phase Euler equations with surface tension, whose inner phase is a bounded connected domain. The solutions have a uniform vorticity distribution in this inner phase and they have a vortex sheet on its surface.   Our construction relies on a perturbative approach around an explicit spherical solution, given by Hill's vortex enclosed by a spherical vortex sheet. The construction is sensitive to the Weber numbers describing the flow. At critical Weber numbers, we perform a bifurcation analysis utilizing the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem in Sobolev spaces on the 2-sphere. Away from these critical numbers, our construction relies on the implicit function theorem.   Our results imply that the model containing surface tension is richer than the ordinary one-phase Euler equations, in the sense that for the latter, Hill's spherical vortex is unique (modulo translations) among all axisymmetric simply connected uniform vortices of a given circulation.",AP,AP,1,0

2503.05410v1,Decay of solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations,Sebastian Herr; Christopher Maulén; Claudio Muñoz,"We study the long-time behavior of small and large solutions to a broad class of nonlinear Dirac-type equations. Our results are classified in 1D massless and massive cases, 3D general and $n$ dimensional in generality. In the 1D massless case we prove that any globally defined solution converges to zero as time tends to infinity, within a spatial region expanding at a rate proportional to $ t \log^{-2} t$. This result holds without assumptions on the smallness of initial data or specific power of nonlinearity, ruling out the existence of standing breather-like or solitary wave structures in this regime. In the 1D massive case, solitary waves are known to exist. Introducing new virial identities adapted to the Dirac's distinctive algebra, we prove that there are ``holomorphic'' odd nonlinearities under which globally defined small odd solutions decay to zero on spatial compact sets as time tends to infinity. This result is extended to the 3D case under boundedness of the $H^1$ norm but without requiring the parity condition on the data, giving decay proofs for an important class of nonlinear Dirac models, and opening the door to the future use of virial identities to prove asymptotic stability of well-chosen Dirac solitary waves.   Finally, in higher dimensions $ n \geq 1$, we prove the $L^2$ decay for global solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations in the ``exterior light-cone'' region. This confirms the non-existence of breathers and other solutions propagating faster than the speed of light. Our proofs rely on carefully constructed weighted virial identities.",AP,AP,1,0

Such equations are numerically challenging as they require large-scale computations and the usage of parallel hardware. Domain decomposition is a common choice of numerical method for stationary domains, as it gives rise to parallel discretizations. In this study, we introduce a variational framework that extends the use of such methods to evolving domains. In particular, we prove that transmission problems on evolving domains are well posed and equivalent to the corresponding parabolic problems. This in turn implies that the standard non-overlapping domain decompositions, including the Robin-Robin method, become well defined approximations. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the Robin--Robin method. The framework is based on a generalization of fractional Sobolev-Bochner spaces on evolving domains, time-dependent Steklov-Poincar\'e operators, and elements of the approximation theory for monotone maps.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

The first results concern the monotonicity of the Malthus parameter with respect to the coefficients. Existence of a solution to the associated eigenproblem is then stated in the case of a finite set of growth rates thanks to Kre\u{i}n-Rutman theorem and a series of estimates on moments. Afterwards, adapting the classical general relative entropy (GRE) method enables us to ensure uniqueness of the eigenelements and derive the long-time asymptotics of the Cauchy problem. We prove convergence towards the steady state including in the case of individual exponential growth known to exhibit oscillations at large times in absence of variability. A few numerical simulations are eventually performed in the case of linear growth rate to illustrate our monotonicity results and the fact that variability, providing enough mixing in the heterogeneous population, is sufficient to re-establish asynchronicity.",AP,AP,1,0

Second, by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, we prove for any time the lack of averaged exact controllability in a $L^2$ setting for all absolutely continuous random variables. Notably, this implies that this property is not inherited from the exact controllability of the Schr\""odinger equation.

The exponential decay rate in these estimates is optimal, in the sense that it cannot be improved based solely on a uniform bound on the Ricci curvature.   The paper offers two conceptual takeaways. Firstly, in pursuit of decay estimates, it may be worth shifting the emphasis from the resolvent kernel to its density - a geometrically more natural object. Secondly, contrary to expectations, the exponential decay of the resolvent kernel is driven mainly by the area/volume growth, and the bottom of the spectrum of $\Delta$ is not a decisive factor. This is in contrast with the heat kernel decay, and shows that optimal resolvent kernel estimates cannot be implied from heat kernel estimates.",AP,AP,1,0

Fractional order spatial derivatives are discretized using weighted averaging approximations in conjunction with standard and shifted Gr\""{u}nwald formulas. The advective term is handled utilizing a straightforward Euler formula, resulting in a semi-discretized system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The conservativeness of the proposed scheme is rigorously proved and validated through simulation experiments. The study is further advanced to a fully discretized, semi-adaptive finite difference method. Detailed analysis is implemented for the monotonicity, positivity and stability of the scheme. Investigations are carried out to assess the potential impacts of the fractional order on quenching location, quenching time, and critical length. The computational results are thoroughly discussed and analyzed, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the quenching phenomena modeled through two-sided fractional order convection-diffusion problems.",AP,AP,1,0

The flow under consideration is governed by the three-dimensional steady compressible Euler equations. In conical coordinates, the problem can be reformulated as an oblique derivative problem for a nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation. By establishing a crucial Lipschitz estimate, we show that the equation is uniformly elliptic in any subdomain that is strictly away from the degenerate boundary. Using this property, we finally prove the unique existence of a solution to this problem via the method of continuity, provided that the apex angle of the conical body is less than a critical angle determined by the oncoming flow.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.03354v1,Bôcher type theorem for elliptic equations with drift perturbed Lévy operator,Tomasz Klimsiak,"A classical B\^ocher's theorem asserts that any positive harmonic function (with respect to the Laplacian) in the punctured unit ball can be expressed, up to the multiplication constant, as the sum of the Newtonian kernel and a positive function that is harmonic in the whole unit ball. This theorem expresses one of the fundamental results in the theory of isolated singularities and it can be viewed as a statement on the asymptotic behavior of positive harmonic functions near their isolated singularities. In the paper we generalize this results to drift perturbed L\'evy operators. We propose a new approach based on the probabilistic potential theory. It applies to L\'evy operators for which the resolvent of its perturbation is strongly Feller. In particular our result encompasses drift perturbed fractional Laplacians with any stability index bounded between zero and two - the method therefore applies to subcritical and supercritical cases.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.03343v1,A parabolic Hardy-Hénon equation with quasilinear degenerate diffusion,Razvan Gabriel Iagar; Philippe Laurençot,"Local and global well-posedness, along with finite time blow-up, are investigated for the following Hardy-H\'enon equation involving a quasilinear degenerate diffusion and a space-dependent superlinear source featuring a singular potential $$\partial_t u=\Delta u^m+|x|^{\sigma}u^p,\quad t>0,\ x\in\mathbb{R}^N,$$ when $m>1$, $p>1$ and $\sigma\in \big(\max\{-2,-N\},0 \big)$. While the superlinear source induces finite time blow-up when $\sigma=0$, whatever the value of $p>1$, at least for sufficiently large initial conditions, a striking effect of the singular potential $|x|^\sigma$ is the prevention of finite time blow-up for suitably small values of $p$, namely, $1<p\le p_G := [2-\sigma(m-1)]/2$. Such a result, as well as the local existence of solutions for $p>p_G$, is obtained by employing the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities. Another interesting feature is that uniqueness and comparison principle hold true for generic non-negative initial conditions when $p>p_G$, but their validity is restricted to initial conditions which are positive in a neighborhood of $x=0$ when $p\in (1,p_G)$, a range in which non-uniqueness holds true without this positivity condition. Finite time blow-up of any non-trivial, non-negative solution is established when $p_G<p\leq p_F:=m+(\sigma+2)/N$, while global existence for small initial data in some critical Lebesgue spaces and blow-up in finite time for initial data with a negative energy are proved for $p>p_F$.

In this paper we prove uniqueness of the mass renormalisation that leads to gauge covariant solutions. This strengthens the main result of (arXiv:2201.03487), and is potentially important for the identification of the limit of other approximations, such as lattice dynamics.

The proposed mathematical investigation identifies and proves the limitations of variational models with respect to non-variational ones, the latter yielding a feasible description of real instances in all relevant situations and regimes.

2503.02654v1,Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations in the Wasserstein Space for the Optimal Control of the Kushner-Stratonovich Equation,Hexiang Wan; Jie Xiong,"This paper develops a comparison theorem for viscosity solutions of a new class of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, which is used to solve the separated problem governed by the K-S equation in the Wasserstein space. A distinctive feature of these HJB equations is the simultaneous presence of variational and Lions derivatives, an inevitable consequence of a nonzero observation function. Moreover, the presence of state-dependent correlated noise adds further complexity to the analysis, making the proof of the comparison theorem more challenging. The core proof strategy for the comparison theorem is to introduce a novel adaptation of the doubling variables argument, specifically tailored to tackle the challenges posed by the Wasserstein space. To this end, we construct an entirely new bivariate functional that combines viscosity sub/supsolutions, a smooth gauge-type function, and two Gaussian regularized entropy penalizations. The gauge-type function compensates for the non-differentiability (in the Lions sense) of the 2-Wasserstein distance, while the entropy penalizations ensure that the maximal point of the functional is well-behaved. Another major contribution of this paper is the derivation of the second-order variational and Lions derivatives of the gauge-type function and entropy functional, which are crucial for dealing with the second-order HJB equation. Meanwhile, the simple structure and pleasing regularity of these derivatives make the methodologies developed in this paper applicable within a wider range of theoretical settings.

We classify all smooth mode solutions for growth rates $\lambda$ with $\mathrm{Re} \, \lambda \geq 0$ and demonstrate that the blow-up solution is stable up to the mode solutions arising from the symmetry group of the wave maps equation. Our proof relies on a decomposition of the linearised wave maps equation into a tractable system of symmetry-equivariant ordinary differential equations (ODEs), utilising the representation theory of the stabiliser of the blow-up solution.

We always assume that the initial datum has suitable finite moments (often, finite first moment). All estimates include an explicit rate of approach to the asymptotic profiles at the different scales natural to the problem, in analogy with the Gaussian behaviour of the heat equation in the full space. As a consequence we obtain by an approximation procedure the asymptotic profile, with rates, for the Dirichlet heat kernel in these exterior domains. The estimates on the rates are new even when the domain is the complement of the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$, except for previous results by Uchiyama in dimension 2, which we are able to improve in some scales. We obtain that the heat kernel behaves asymptotically as the heat kernel in the full space, with a factor that takes into account the shape of the domain through a harmonic profile, and a second factor which accounts for the loss of mass through the boundary.

This method bears similarities with the phase screen method used routinely to solve such problems. The main axis of propagation is discretized by a centered splitting scheme with step $\Delta z$ while the transverse variables are treated by a spectral method after appropriate spatial truncation. The originality of our approach is its theoretical validity even when the typical wavelength $\theta$ of the propagating signal satisfies $\theta\ll\Delta z$. More precisely, we obtain a convergence of order $\Delta z$ in mean-square sense while the errors on statistical moments are of order $(\Delta z)^2$ as expected for standard centered splitting schemes. This is a surprising result as splitting schemes typically do not converge when $\Delta z$ is not the smallest scale of the problem.

This allows us to systematically establish decay estimates for a given system and uncover algebraic cancellations (beyond the reach of the Kalman-based approach) reducing the loss of derivatives in high frequencies.

Given a well understood and well behaved bi-invariant Laplacian, $\Delta$, and a sub-Laplacian, $L$, to which intrinsic distances, $d_\Delta$, $d_L$, are naturally attached, we show that a comparison inequality of the form $d_L\le C(d_\Delta)^c$ (for some $0<c\le 1$) implies that the Dirichlet form of a fractional power of $\Delta$ is dominated by the Dirichlet form associated with $L$. We use this result to show that, under additional assumptions, certain good properties of the heat kernel for $\Delta$ are then passed to the heat kernel associated with $L$. Explicit examples on the infinite product of copies of $SU(2)$ are discussed to illustrate these results.",AP,AP,1,0

With our approach, that uses consistently matrices on ${\mathbb C}^N$ instead of operators on $L^2$, we circumvent a variety of analytical subtleties in the analysis of the original nlQDD equation, e.g. related to positivity of densities or to the quantum exponential function.   Our starting point is spatially discretized quantum Boltzmann equation with a BGK-type collision kernel, from which we derive the discretized nlQDD model in the diffusive limit. Then we verify that solutions dissipate the von-Neumann entropy, which is a known key property of the original nlQDD, and prove global existence of positive solutions, which seems to be a particular feature of the discretization. Our main result concerns convergence of the scheme: discrete solutions converge -- locally uniformly with respect to space and time -- to classical solutions of the the original nlQDD model on any time interval $[0,T)$ on which the latter remain positive. In particular, this extends the existence theory for nlQDD, that has been established only for initial data close to equilibrium so far.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2502.21023v1,Sharp Boundary Estimates and Harnack Inequalities for Fractional Porous Medium type Equation,Matteo Bonforte; Carlos Fuertes Moran,"This paper provides sharp quantitative and constructive estimates of nonnegative solutions $u(t,x)\geq 0$ to the nonlinear fractional diffusion equation, $$\partial_t u +{\mathcal L} F(u)=0,$$ also known as filtration equation, posed in a smooth bounded domain $x\in \Omega \subset {\mathbb R}^N$ with suitable homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Both the operator ${\mathcal L}$ and the nonlinearity $F$ belong to a general class. The assumption on ${\mathcal L}$ are set in terms of the kernel of ${\mathcal L}$ and/or ${\mathcal L}^{-1}$, and allow for operators with degenerate kernel at the boundary of $\Omega$. The main examples of ${\mathcal L}$ are the three different Dirichlet Fractional Laplacians on bounded domains, and the nonlinearity can be non-homogeneous, for instance, $F(u)=u^2+u^{10}$. Previous result were known in the porous medium case, i.e. $F(u)=|u|^{m-1} u$ with $m>1$. Our aim here is to perform the next step: a delicate analysis of regularity through quantitative, constructive and sharp a priori estimates. Our main results are global Harnack type inequalities $$H_0(t,u_0)\, {\rm dist}(x, \partial \Omega)^a\leq F(u(t,x))\leq H_1(t)\, {\rm dist}(x, \partial \Omega)^b\qquad\forall (t,x)\in (0,\infty)\times \overline{\Omega},$$ where the expressions of $H_0, H_1$ and $a,b$ are explicit and may change according to ${\mathcal L}$ and $F$. The sharpness of such estimates is proven by means of examples and counterexamples: on the one hand, we can match the powers (i.e. $a=b$) when the operator has a non degenerate kernel. On the other hand, when ${\mathcal L}$ has a kernel that degenerates at the boundary $\partial\Omega$, there appear an intriguing anomalous boundary behaviour: the size of the initial data determines the sharp boundary behaviour of the solution, different for ``small'' and ``large'' initial data.

It is known that the sign of the real part of the dissipation coefficient affects the long-time behavior of solutions, when neither size restriction on the initial data nor strong dissipative condition is imposed. In that case, if the sign is negative, then Gerelmaa, the first and third author [7] obtained the $L^{2}$-decay estimate under the restriction $p \le 1+1/d$. In this paper, we relax the restriction to $p \le 1+4/(3d)$ by refining an energy-type estimate.

By reformulating the PDE as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and leveraging Chebyshev series in time, we reduce the problem to a zero-finding task for Fourier-Chebyshev coefficients. A key theoretical contribution is the derivation of an explicit decay estimate for the inverse of the linear part of the PDE, enabling larger time steps. This allows the construction of an approximate inverse for the Fr\'echet derivative and the application of a Newton-Kantorovich theorem to establish solution existence within explicit error bounds.

In both cases, we employ a spacetime foliation given in terms of compactified hyperboloidal slices. These slices intersect future null infinity, so our method is well-suited to study the long-time behaviour of waves. Moreover, our construction is adapted to the presence of the time--dependent scale factor that describes the underlying spacetime expansion. First, we investigate decay rates for solutions to the linear wave equation in a large class of expanding FLRW spacetimes, whose non--compact spatial sections have either zero or negative curvature. By means of a hyperboloidal foliation, we provide new numerical evidence for the sharpness of decay--in--time estimates for linear waves propagating in such spacetimes. Then, in the spatially-flat case, we present numerical results in support of small data global existence of solutions to semi-linear wave equations in FLRW spacetimes having a decelerated expansion, provided that a generalized null condition holds. In absence of this null condition and in the specific case of $ \square_g \phi = (\partial_t \phi)^2 $ (Fritz John's choice), the results we obtain suggest that, when the spacetime expansion is sufficiently slow, solutions diverge in finite time for every choice of initial data.",AP,AP,1,0

In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via dynamically truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent local Goursat PDEs by recursively propagating boundary conditions along a directed graph via topological ordering, with dynamic truncation adaptively terminating each local power series expansion when coefficients fall below machine precision, striking an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy. This method achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel, providing (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (e.g., with up to half a million points or more) on a single GPU.

All these analytical results hold under a specific assumption on the collision kernel corresponding to cut-off and hard-potentials type.

Quantum Magnus algorithms, designed to achieve commutator scaling for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation, have been found to be particularly efficient for such applications. When applied to unbounded Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture, they exhibit an unexpected superconvergence phenomenon. However, existing proofs are limited to the spatially continuous setting and do not extend to discrete spatial discretizations. In this work, we provide the first superconvergence estimate in the fully discrete setting with a finite number of spatial discretization points $N$, and show that it holds with an error constant uniform in $N$. The proof is based on the two-parameter symbol class, which, to our knowledge, is applied for the first time in algorithm analysis. The key idea is to establish a semiclassical framework by identifying two parameters through the discretization number and the time step size rescaled by the operator norm, such that the semiclassical uniformity guarantees the uniformity of both.

The square of the first order operator is of Laplace type; on the metric graph, the function (0-form) component is the usual standard (Kirchhoff) Laplacian.

These are manifested through a distinctive mode of propagation of singularities in the solutions. Precisely, the singularities of the solutions propagate periodically in a bidirectional fashion along the time axis. Furthermore, this propagation occurs in a stepwise manner. More specifically, when propagating in the positive time direction, the order of the joint derivatives of the solution increases by 2 for each period; conversely, when propagating in the reverse time direction, the order of the joint derivatives decreases by 2 per period. Additionally, we elucidate the way in which the initial data and historical values impact such a propagation of singularities.

2502.18849v1,Convergence of random splitting method for the Allen-Cahn equation in a background flow,Lei Li; Chen Wang,"We study in this paper the convergence of the random splitting method for Allen-Cahn equation in a background flow that plays as a simplified model for phase separation in multiphase flows. The model does not own the gradient flow structure as the usual Allen-Cahn equation does, and the random splitting method is advantageous due to its simplicity and better convergence rate. Though the random splitting is a classical method, the analysis of the convergence is not straightforward for this model due to the nonlinearity and unboundedness of the operators. We obtain uniform estimates of various Sobolev norms of the numerical solutions and the stability of the model. Based on the Sobolev estimates, the local trunction errors are then rigorously obtained. We then prove that the random operator splitting has an expected single run error with order $1.5$ and a bias with order $2$. Numerical experiments are then performed to confirm our theoretic findings.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2502.18809v2,Type-I Superconductors in the Limit as the London Penetration Depth Goes to 0,Charles L. Epstein; Manas Rachh; Yuguan Wang,"This paper provides an explicit formula for the approximate solution of the static London equations. These equations describe the currents and magnetic fields in a Type-I superconductor. We represent the magnetic field as a 2-form and the current as a 1-form, and assume that the superconducting material is contained in a bounded, connected set, $\Omega,$ with smooth boundary. The London penetration depth gives an estimate for the thickness of the layer near $\partial\Omega$ where the current is largely carried. In an earlier paper, we introduced a system of Fredholm integral equations of second kind, on $\partial\Omega,$ for solving the physically relevant scattering problems in this context. In real Type-I superconductors the penetration depth is very small, typically about $100$nm, which often renders the integral equation approach computationally intractable. In this paper we provide an explicit formula for approximate solutions, with essentially optimal error estimates, as the penetration depth tends to zero. Our work makes extensive use of the Hodge decomposition of differential forms on manifolds with boundary, and thus evokes Kohn's work on the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations.",AP,AP,1,0

In the chosen scaling, the fermions induce an effective attraction among the bosons, which competes with their intrinsic repulsive interaction. Our main result demonstrates the convergence of the eigenvalues towards those of an effective Bose Hamiltonian. For short-range potentials, we apply this result to derive a stability-instability transition in the bosonic subsystem, driven by the Bose-Fermi coupling strength $g$.

2502.18677v1,A new asymptotic regime for the KdV equation with Wigner-von Neumann type initial data,Alexei Rybkin,"We investigate the long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the KdV equation, focusing on the evolution of the radiant wave associated with a Wigner-von Neumann (WvN) resonance induced by the initial data (potential). A WvN resonance refers to an energy level where the potential exhibits zero transmission (complete reflection). The corresponding Jost solution at such energy becomes singular, and in the NLS context, this is referred to as a spectral singularity. A WvN resonance represents a long-range phenomenon, often introducing significant challenges, such as an infinite negative spectrum, when employing the inverse scattering transform (IST). To avoid some of these issues, we consider a restricted class of initial data that generates a WvN resonance but for which the IST framework can be suitably adapted. For this class of potentials, we demonstrate that each WvN resonance produces a distinct asymptotic regime -- termed the resonance regime -- characterized by a slower decay rate for large time compared to the radiant waves associated with short-range initial data.",AP,AP,1,0

2502.18421v2,A new framework for Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory and its application to planar Choquard equations,Omar Cabrera; Silvia Cingolani; Tobias Weth,"We consider the planar logarithmic Choquard equation $$- \Delta u + a(x)u + (\log|\cdot| \ast u^2)u = 0,\qquad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^2$$ in the strongly indefinite and possibly degenerate setting where no sign condition is imposed on the linear potential $a \in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2)$. In particular, we shall prove the existence of a sequence of high energy solutions to this problem in the case where $a$ is invariant under $\mathbb{Z}^2$-translations.   The result extends to a more general $G$-equivariant setting, for which we develop a new variational approach which allows us to find critical points of Ljusternik-Schnirelmann type. In particular, our method resolves the problem that the energy functional $\Phi$ associated with the logarithmic Choquard equation is only defined on a subspace $X \subset H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with the property that $\|\cdot\|_X$ is not translation invariant. The new approach is based on a new $G$-equivariant version of the Cerami condition and on deformation arguments adapted to a family of suitably constructed scalar products $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_u$, $u \in X$ with the $G$-equivariance property $\langle g \ast v , g \ast w \rangle_{g \ast u} = \langle v , w \rangle_u.$",AP,AP,1,0

The semigroup needs to satisfy a convexity estimate, so called $K$-convexity, w.r.t. another family of operators, defined on a potentially larger locally convex vector lattice. We then show that, under mild continuity requirements on the bounding family of operators, the semigroup yields viscosity solutions to the abstract Cauchy problem given in terms of its generator in the larger locally convex vector lattice.

Here $\gamma>0$, $ N\geq 1$, $\alpha\in(0,N)$, $I_{\alpha}$ is the Riesz potential, and the unknown $\lambda$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier. In a mass supercritical setting on $g$, we find regions in the $(c,\mu)$--parameter space such that the corresponding equation admits a positive radial ground state solution. To overcome the lack of compactness resulting from the nonlocal term, we present a novel compactness lemma and some prior energy estimate. These results are even new for the power type nonlinearity $g(u)= |u|^{q-2}u$ with $2+\frac{4}{N}<q<2^*$ ($2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2}$, if $N\geq 3$ and $2^* = \infty$, if $N=1, 2$). We also show that as $\mu$ or $c$ tends to $0$ (resp. $\mu$ or $c$ tends to $+\infty$), after a suitable rescaling the ground state solutions converge in $H^1(\RN)$ to a particular solution of the limit equations. Further, we study the non-existence and multiplicity of positive radial solutions to \begin{equation*}   -\Delta u + u = \eta |u|^{q-2}u + (I_\alpha * |u|^{\frac{N+\alpha}{N}})|u|^{\frac{N+\alpha}{N}-2}u, \quad \text{in}\ \ \RN \end{equation*} where $N \geq 1$, $ 2< q<2^*$ and $\eta>0$. Based on some analytical ideas the limit behaviors of the normalized solutions, we verify some threshold regions of $\eta$ such that the corresponding equation has no positive least action solution or admits multiple positive solutions.

In dimension $d \ge 4$, we construct an axially symmetric cone whose contact set has with positive density. We show that it is a global minimizer. It is analogous to the De Silva-Jerison \cite{DJ} cone for the Alt-Caffarelli functional which corresponds to exponent $\gamma=0$. The cone we construct bifurcates from another minimizing cone whose contact set has zero density, obtained as the trivial extension of the radial solution. This second cone is analogous to a quadratic polynomial solution in the classical obstacle problem which corresponds to exponent $\gamma=1$. In particular our results show that, when $\gamma<1$ is sufficiently close to 1, there are axis symmetric cones that exhibit the properties of both end point cases $\gamma=0$ and $\gamma=1$.",AP,AP,1,0

So far, the best analytic result $Fr < \sqrt{2}$ was obtained by Starr (1947), while the numerical evidence of Longuet-Higgins & Fenton (1974) states $Fr \le 1.294$. On the other hand, as shown recently by Kozlov (2023), the upper bound $Fr < 1.399$ is related to the existence of subharmonic bifurcations of Stokes waves. In this paper, we develop a new strategy utilizing the flow force function and rigorously establish the improved upper bound $Fr < 1.37838$.",AP,AP,1,0

This is achieved via new structure equations for a connection introduced by Rivi\`ere in the study of weakly harmonic maps, combined with Coulomb-frame methods and the Hardy-BMO duality of Fefferman-Stein.

Firstly, we replace pointwise domination with ($m+1$)-linear stochastic fractional reducing sparse form ${\mathcal B}_{\alpha(\eta) ,\mathcal{S},\tau,\tau',{\vec r},t}^\mathbf{b,k}$, thus providing a new approach to the vector-valued multilinear stochastic fractional sparse domination principle. Additionally, the conditions required for this result are relaxed from multilinear weak type boundedness in \cite{CenSong2412} to multilinear locally weak type boundedness $W_{\vec{p}, q}(X)$, which allows us to extend the main ideas from Lerner \cite{Lerner2019} (2019) and Lorist et al. \cite{Lorist2024} (2024). Secondly, and more importantly, we move away from the original techniques of quantitatively estimating multilinear stochastic fractional sparse operators ${\mathcal A}_{\alpha(\eta),\mathcal{S},\tau,{\vec{r}},t}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$, and instead employ a more powerful multilinear fractional \( \vec{r} \)-type maximal operator $\mathscr{M}_{\alpha(\eta),\vec{r}}$. This necessitates the development of a new class of multilinear fractional weights $ A_{(\vec{p},q),(\vec{r}, s)}(X)$ to quantitatively characterize this maximal operator, followed by revealing the norm equivalence between this maximal operator and the sparse forms introduced earlier, thereby generalizing part of the ideas of Nieraeth \cite{Nier2019} (2019). ......",AP,AP,1,0

2502.17094v1,Qualitative quasi-invariance of low regularity Gaussian measures for the 1d quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation,Alexis Knezevitch,"We consider the 1d quintic nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLS) on the torus with initial data distributed according to the Gaussian measures with covariance operator $(1-\Delta)^{-s}$, and denoted $\mu_s$. For the full range $s>\frac{9}{10}$, we prove that these Gaussian measures are quasi-invariant along the flow of (NLS), meaning that the law of the solution at any time is absolutely continuous with respect to the initial Gaussian measure. Moreover, the condition $s>\frac{9}{10}$ corresponds to the threshold where the Sobolev space $H^{\frac{2}{5}+}(\mathbb{T})$ is of $\mu_s$-full measure (it is of zero $\mu_s$-measure otherwise). This is the lower regularity Sobolev space where we currently know that (NLS) is globally well-posed, thanks to a work by LI-WU-XU. The present work extends the known threshold $s>\frac{3}{2}$ for the quasi-invariance down to $s>\frac{9}{10}$, but we do not obtain here quantitative results on the Radon-Nikodym derivatives. Our approach is based on a work of Sun-Tzvetkov, combining a Poincar\'e-Dulac normal form reduction with energy estimates.

The case of spherical triangles has been recently shown to be different: on the sphere, besides equilateral triangles, a necessary and sufficient condition for a given triangle to enjoy the above Napoleonic property is that its congruence class should lie on a suitable surface (namely, an ellipsoid in suitable coordinates). In this article we show that the hyperbolic case is significantly different from both the Euclidean and the spherical setting. Specifically, we establish here that the hyperbolic plane does not admit any Napoleonic triangle, except the equilateral ones. Furthermore, we prove that iterated Napoleonization of any triangle causes it to become smaller and smaller, more and more equilateral and converge to a single point in the limit.",AP,AP,1,0
2502.16929v1,On the functional Minkowski problem,Tomer Falah; Liran Rotem,"To every log-concave function $f$ one may associate a pair of measures $(\mu_{f},\nu_{f})$ which are the surface area measures of $f$. These are a functional extension of the classical surface area measure of a convex body, and measure how the integral $\int f$ changes under perturbations. The functional Minkowski problem then asks which pairs of measures can be obtained as the surface area measures of a log-concave function. In this work we fully solve this problem.   Furthermore, we prove that the surface area measures are continuous in correct topology: If $f_{k}\to f$, then $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)\to\left(\mu_{f},\nu_{f}\right)$ in the appropriate sense. Finding the appropriate mode of convergence of the pairs $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)$ sheds a new light on the construction of functional surface area measures. To prove this continuity theorem we associate to every convex function a new type of radial function, which seems to be an interesting construction on its own right.   Finally, we prove that the solution to functional Minkowski problem is continuous in the data, in the sense that if $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)\to\left(\mu_{f},\nu_{f}\right)$ then $f_{k}\to f$ up to translations.",AP,AP,1,0

Nonetheless, we show that every epigraph admits at most one strictly stable solution. To prove uniqueness, we strengthen the method of moving planes by decomposing the domain into one region where solutions are stable and another where they enjoy a form of compactness.

It is proved that such stationary profile solutions are linearly (and nonlinearly) unstable under the flow of the sine-Gordon model on the graph. The extension theory of symmetric operators, Sturm-Liouville oscillation results and analytic perturbation theory of operators are fundamental ingredients in the stability analysis. The local well-posedness of the sine-Gordon model in an appropriate energy space is also established.

In this paper, we show that there holds an interior graphical estimate for the Curve Shortening Flow in the spirit of the proposed framework. More precisely, we show the following $ \mathrm{L}^1_\mathrm{loc} $-to-$ \mathrm{L}^\infty_\mathrm{loc} $ estimate: If a smooth Graphical Curve Shortening Flow $ u : (-1, 1) \times [0, T) \mapsto \mathbb{R} $ starts from a function $ u_0 := u( \, \cdot \, , 0) : (-1, 1) \mapsto \mathbb{R} $ with $ \mathrm{L}^1(\!(-1,1)\!) $ norm strictly less than $ \pi T $, then after waiting for the 'magic time' $ t_\star : = \| u_0 \|_{\mathrm{L}^1(\!(-1,1)\!)} / \pi $, the size $ |u(0, t)| $ of $ u( \, \cdot \, , t) $ at the origin at any time $ t \in (t_\star, T) $ is controlled purely in terms of $ \| u_0 \|_{\mathrm{L}^1(\!(-1,1)\!)} $ and $ t - t_\star $.

The notions we introduce rely on the parabolic maximum principle and extend some earlier definitions introduced for elliptic operators [BNV].   We first show that these eigenvalues hold the key to understanding the large time behavior and entire solutions of heterogeneous Fisher-KPP type equations. We then describe the relation of these quantities with principal Floquet bundles for parabolic operators which provides further characterizations of the principal eigenvalues. These allow us to derive monotonicity properties and comparisons between generalized principal eigenvalues, as well as perturbation results and further properties involving limit operators. We show that the sign of these eigenvalues encodes different versions of the maximum principle for parabolic operators.

Specifically, for any generator $-A$ of an analytic semigroup on a Banach space $X$, we identify the interpolation spaces between $X$ and the domain $D_{A}$ of $A$ in which the part of $A$ satisfies certain maximal regularity estimates. We also establish several new results concerning both homogeneous and inhomogeneous $L^1$-maximal regularity estimates, extending and completing recent findings in the literature. These results are motivated not only by applications to problems in areas such as fluid mechanics but also by the intrinsic theoretical interest of the subject. In particular, we address the optimal choice of data spaces for the Cauchy problem associated with $A$, ensuring the existence of strong solutions with global-in-time control of their derivatives. This control is measured via the homogeneous parts of the interpolation norms in the spatial variable and weighted Lebesgue norms over the time interval. Furthermore, we characterize weighted $L^1$-estimates and establish their relationship with unweighted estimates. Additionally, we reformulate the characterization condition for $L^1$-maximal regularity due to Kalton and Portal in a priori terms that do not rely on semigroup operators.

To understand nonlinear phenomena such as failure and morphological instabilities in these systems, accurate numerical models are required to study the interaction between mass addition and stress in complex geometrical and physical settings. Despite recent progress in the formulation of models of surface growth of deformable solids, current numerical approaches require several simplifying assumptions.   This work formulates a method that couples an Eulerian surface growth description to a phase-field approach. It further develops a finite element implementation to solve the model numerically using a fixed computational domain with a fixed discretization. This approach bypasses the challenges that arise in a Lagrangian approach, such as having to construct a four-dimensional reference configuration, remeshing, and/or changing the computational domain over the course of the numerical solution. It also enables the modeling of several settings -- such as non-normal growth of biological tissues and stress-induced growth -- which can be challenging for available methods.   The numerical approach is demonstrated on a model problem that shows non-normal growth, wherein growth occurs by the motion of the surface in a direction that is not parallel to the normal of the surface, that can occur in hard biological tissues such as nails, horns, etc. Next, a thermomechanical model is formulated and used to investigate the kinetics of freezing and melting in ice under complex stress states, particularly to capture regelation which is a key process in frost heave and basal slip in glaciers.",AP,AP,1,0

When the initial value is a delta potential well, the asymptotic solution is predominantly dominated by a single soliton in certain region for $x>0$, while in other regions, the dispersive tails including self-similar region, collisionless shock region and dispersive wave region, play a more significant role. Conversely, when the initial value is a delta potential barrier, the soliton region is absent, although the dispersive tails still persist. Moreover, the general delta function initial profile with $L$-spikes is also studied and it is proved that one to $L$ solitons will be generated in soliton region, which depends on the sizes of the distance and height of the spikes.

First, we demonstrate that the Boussinesq equations admit steady-state solutions only in the form of hydrostatic equilibria, given by $(\mathbf{u},\rho,p)=(0,\rho_s,p_s)$, where the pressure gradient satisfies $\nabla p_s=-\rho_s\nabla f$. Subsequently, we establish that any hydrostatic equilibrium satisfying the condition $\nabla \rho_s=\delta (x,y)\nabla f$ is linearly unstable if $\delta(x,y)$ is positive at some point $(x,y)=(x_0,y_0)$, This instability corresponds to the well-known Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Thirdly, by employing a series of regularity estimates, we reveal that although the presence of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability increases the velocity, the system ultimately converges to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This result is achieved by analyzing perturbations around any state of hydrostatic equilibrium, including both stable and unstable configurations. Specifically, the state of hydrostatic equilibrium can be expressed as $\rho=-\gamma f+\beta$,where $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are positive constants, provided that the global perturbation satisfies additional conditions. This highlights the system's tendency to stabilize into a hydrostatic state despite the presence of instabilities.",AP,AP,1,0

We show that the system possesses a unique steady-state, whose stability depends on the policy governing prescribed burning. Specifically, a Reactive Policy in which prescribed burning activities are increased in response to bushfire events risks to produce instability and requires an additional feedback control, while a Proactive Policy in which moderate prescribed burning replaces natural bushfires may be more effective to maintain a balanced state. A high regeneration factor is also helpful to ensuring the stability of the equilibrium state.   The results presented here should not be regarded as a definitive solution to the issue of prescribed burning, as numerous specific factors must be considered in any comprehensive policymaking approach. Nonetheless, the stability analysis developed in this paper suggests that policies driven primarily by reactive responses to bushfire events may be emotionally charged and prone to instability. These reactive policies would benefit from incorporating feedback control mechanisms. In contrast, strategies based on proactive prescribed burning in moderate quantities, focused on prevention rather than reaction, are likely to be more effective in maintaining long-term ecological stability.",AP,AP,1,0

In the special case where the driving L\'evy process is Brownian motion, one recovers the classical diffusion OU semigroup, whose spectral properties have been extensively studied over past few decades. Our main results establish that, under suitable conditions on the L\'evy process, the spectrum of the L\'evy-OU semigroup in the $L^p$-space weighted with the invariant distribution coincides with that of the diffusion OU semigroup. Furthermore, when the drift matrix $B$ is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues, we derive explicit formulas for eigenfunctions and co-eigenfunctions--an observation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared in the literature. We also show that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues remain independent of the choice of the L\'evy process.

2502.14468v1,Non-radiating elastic sources in inhomogeneous elastic media at corners with applications,Huaian Diao; Yueran Geng; Ruixiang Tang,"This paper is concerned with non-radiating elastic sources in inhomogeneous elastic media. We demonstrate that the value of non-radiating elastic sources must vanish at convex corners of their support, provided the sources exhibit H\""older continuous regularity near the corner. Additionally, their gradient must satisfy intricate algebraic relationships with the angles defining the underlying corners, assuming the sources have $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity with $\alpha\in (0,1)$ in the neighborhood of the corners. To perform microlocal analysis around the corners, we employ the so-called complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions as test functions within a partial differential system. These characterizations of non-radiating elastic sources in inhomogeneous elastic media at corners enable us to establish the unique identifiability results for determining the position and shape of radiating elastic sources by a single far-field measurement, both locally and globally. The uniqueness result by a single far-field measurement is a challenging problem with a colorful history in inverse scattering. Indeed, when the support of a radiating elastic source is a convex polygon, we can simultaneously determine the shape of the elastic source and its values at the corners, provided the source is H\""older continuous at the corner. Furthermore, when the source function exhibits $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity in the neighborhood of a corner, the gradient of the source function at that corner can also be generically determined.",AP,AP,1,0

The governing equation is derived using fundamental principles from continuum mechanics. A new scaling is introduced, allowing for a systematic analysis of different flow regimes. We prove the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of a bounded positive solution to Washburn's equation that includes the slip parameter, as well as the continuous dependence of the solution in the maximum norm on the initial data. Thus, the initial-value problem for Washburn's equation is shown to be well-posed in the sense of Hadamard. Additionally, we show that the unique equilibrium solution may be reached either monotonically or in an oscillatory fashion, similarly to the no-slip case. Finally, we determine the basin of attraction for the system, ensuring that the equilibrium state will be reached from the initial data we impose. These results hold for any positive value of the nondimensional slip parameter in the model, and for all values of the ratio $h_0/h_e$ in the range $[0,3/2]$, where $h_0$ is the initial height of the fluid column and $h_e$ is its equilibrium height.",AP,AP,1,0

On the other hand, Li-Xiong established compactness in dimensions $5\leq n \leq 9$ (under some conditions). Our principal observation is that the linearized equation associated with the $Q$-curvature problem can be transformed into an overdetermined linear system, which admits a nontrivial solution due to an unexpected algebraic structure of the Paneitz operator.

First, we prove existence of action ground-state for generic single-knot graphs, even in the absence of an associated variational problem. Second, for regular single-knot graphs of length $\ell$, we perform a complete analysis of positive monotone bound-states. Furthermore, we characterize all positive bound-states when $\ell$ is small and prove some symmetry-breaking results for large $\ell$.

The model allows for the degeneracy of the mobility at specific concentration values, demonstrating that the solution remains within physically relevant bounds. The introduction of anisotropy leads to highly nonlinear terms making energy and entropy estimates rather involved. As the mobility degenerates in the pure phases, the degenerate Cahn--Hilliard equation describes surface diffusion and is an important model to model solid-state dewetting (SSD) of thin films.

The inertial term is motivated by the occurrence of rapid phase transformation processes in nonequilibrium dynamics. A double-well potential is well chosen and the related nonlinearity governing the evolution is assumed to satisfy a suitable growth condition. The viscous variant of the Cahn--Hilliard system is also considered along with the inertial term. The existence of a global solution is proved via the analysis of some approximate problems with Yosida regularizations, and the use of the Cauchy--Lipschitz--Picard theorem in an abstract setting.

2502.13411v1,Concentration phenomena to a chemotaxis system with indirect signal production,Yuri Soga,"We consider a parabolic-ODE-parabolic chemotaxis system with radially symmetric initial data in a two-dimensional disk under the $0$-Neumann boundary condition. Although our system shares similar mathematical structures as the Keller--Segel system, the remarkable characteristic of the system we consider is that its solutions cannot blow up in finite time. In this paper, focusing on blow-up solutions in infinite time, we confirm concentration phenomena at the origin. It is shown that the radially symmetric solutions of our system have a singularity like a Dirac delta function in infinite time. This means that there exist a time sequence $\{t_k\}$, a weight $m \ge 8\pi$, and a nonnegative function $f \in L^1(\Omega)$ such that \begin{align*} u(\cdot,t_k) \stackrel{*}{\rightharpoonup} m \delta (0) + f\ \mathrm{as}\ t_k \to \infty. \end{align*} We highlight this result is obtained by showing uniform-in-time boundedness of some energy functional. Moreover, we study whether $m = 8\pi$ or $m > 8\pi$, which is an open problem in the Keller--Segel system. It is proved that the weight $m$ of a delta function singularity is larger than $8\pi$ under a specific assumption associated with a Lyapunov functional. This finding suggests the relationship between solutions blowing up in infinite time and an unboundedness of a Lyapunov functional, which contrasts with the Keller--Segel system.",AP,AP,1,0

These kinds of potentials are ''degenerate'', since they detach ''slowly'' from the minima, therefore they provide additional difficulties if one wishes to determine the relative sizes of the ''layers'' and the ''pure phases''. To overcome these challenges, we introduce new barriers allowing us to rely on the fractional Sobolev inequality and on a suitable iteration method.

In this paper, we are concerned with the global existence and nonlinear stability of finite-energy solutions of the multidimensional Euler-Riesz equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry. We consider both attractive and repulsive interactions for a wide range of Riesz and logarithmic potentials for dimensions larger than or equal to two. This is achieved by the inviscid limit of the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the Navier-Stokes-Riesz equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing viscosity solutions is achieved through delicate uniform estimates in $L^p$. It is observed that, even if the attractive potential is super-Coulomb, no concentration is formed near the origin in the inviscid limit. Moreover, we prove that the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the Euler-Riesz equations is unconditional under a spherically symmetric perturbation around the steady solutions. Unlike the Coulomb case where the potential can be represented locally, the singularity and regularity of the nonlocal radial Riesz potential near the origin require careful analysis, which is a crucial step. Finally, unlike the Coulomb case, a Gr\""onwall type estimate is required to overcome the difficulty of the appearance of boundary terms in the sub-Coulomb case and the singularity of the super-Coulomb potential. Furthermore, we prove the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the compressible Euler-Riesz equations around steady states by employing concentration compactness arguments.

In this particular setting, numerical evidence suggests that the particles converge on a short time scale to a ""droplet state"" which is $metastable$, i.e. persists on a much longer time scale than the time scale of convergence, before eventually diffusing to $0$.   In this article, we provide rigorous evidence and a quantitative characterisation of this separation of time scales. Working at the level of the empirical measure, we show that (after quotienting out the motion of the centre of mass) the rate of convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution, which corresponds with the droplet state, is $O(1)$ as the inverse temperature $\beta \to \infty$. Meanwhile the rate of leakage away from its centre of mass is $O(e^{-\beta})$. Futhermore, the quasi-stationary distribution is localised on a length scale of order $O(\beta^{-\frac12})$.

The acceleration g of the gravity is assumed to take a generic value. And a pressure condition is imposed at the exit of the nozzle to determine the position of the shock front, as proposed by R.

It is first shown that the existence of special transonic shock solutions with the flow states depending only on the variable in the gravity direction can be established if and only if the Mach number of the incoming flow satisfies certain conditions. However, the shock position of the special solutions admits shifting in the nozzle. Then we show that the shock position can be determined and the existence of transonic shock solution can be established as the boundary data are small perturbation of one of the special shock solutions and satisfy certain sufficient conditions. Mathematically, the perturbation problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem of a nonlinear mixed-type system, and the key difficulties in the analysis are mainly brought by the vertical gravity.

This problem was addressed in \cite{WY, STW} in the isentropic regime (i.e. $\gamma>1$) for small smooth solutions. In this paper, we prove the global well-posedness and stability of smooth solutions to the three-dimensional isothermal Euler equations ($\gamma=1$) with damping for some partially large initial values, i.e., $\|(\rho_0-\rho_*,u_0)\|_{L^2}$ could be large, but $\|D^3(\rho_0-\rho_*,u_0)\|_{L^2}$ is necessarily small. Moreover, the optimal algebraic decay rate is also obtained.   The proof is based on the observation that the isothermal Euler equations with damping possess a good structure so that the equations can be reduced into a symmetrically hyperbolic system with partial damping, i.e., \eqref{au}. In the new system, all desired a priori estimates can be obtained under the assumption that $\int_0^T(\|\nabla \mathrm{ln}\rho\|_{L^{\infty}}+\|\nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}) \mathrm{d}t $ is small. The assumption can be verified through the low-high frequency analysis via Fourier transformation under the condition that $\|D^3(\rho_0-\rho_*,u_0)\|_{L^2}$ is small, but $\|(\rho_0-\rho_*,u_0)\|_{L^2}$ could be large.",AP,AP,1,0

Zambrano-Luna; Tianxu Wang; Hao Wang,"Cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) pose significant global challenges due to their harmful toxins and socio-economic impacts, with nutrient availability playing a key role in their growth, as described by ecological stoichiometry (ES). However, real-world ecosystems exhibit spatial heterogeneity, limiting the applicability of simpler, spatially uniform models. To address this, we develop a spatially explicit partial differential equation model based on ES to study cyanobacteria in the epilimnion of freshwater systems. We establish the well-posedness of the model and perform a stability analysis, showing that it admits two linearly stable steady states, leading to either extinction or saturation. We use the finite elements method to numerically solve our system on a real lake domain derived from Geographic Information System (GIS) data and realistic wind conditions extrapolated from ERA5-Land. Our numerical results highlight the importance of lake shape and size in CB monitoring, while global sensitivity analysis using Sobol Indices identifies light attenuation and intensity as primary drivers of bloom variation, with water movement influencing early bloom stages and nutrient input becoming critical over time. This model supports continuous water-quality monitoring, informing agricultural, recreational, economic, and public health strategies for mitigating CBs.",AP,AP,1,0
2502.12367v1,An edge crack and a crack close to the vertex of a wedge,Y. A. Antipov,"Two model problems of an elastic wedge with an internal and edge crack are analyzed. The problem of an internal crack reduces to an order-4 vector Riemann-Hilbert problem whose matrix kernel entries are meromorphic functions and have exponential factors. When the internal crack is located along one of the wedge sides, an efficient method of solution is proposed. It requires a factorization of the order-2 matrix coefficient associated with the corresponding problem of an edge crack and the solution of an infinite system of linear algebraic system with an exponential rate of convergence of an approximate solution to the exact one. The order-2 Khrapkov's factorization is modified by splitting the matrix kernel into a scalar dominant function and a ``regular"" matrix whose factorization is more convenient for numerical purposes. Expressions for the stress intensity coefficients and the potential energy released when the crack advances are derived. Asymptotic relations for the stress intensity coefficients and the potential energy when one of the crack tips is close the wedge vertex are obtained.",AP,AP,1,0

Secretion usually takes place over the cell membrane in a spatially heterogeneous manner. Mathematical models of these processes will be part of more elaborate models, e.g. of the movement of immune cells that react to cytokines in their environment. Here, we compare two approaches to modelling of the secretion-diffusion process of signalling compounds. The first is the so-called spatial exclusion model, in which the intracellular space is excluded from consideration and the computational space is the extracellular environment. The second consists of point source models, where the secreting cell is replaced by one or more non-spatial point sources or sinks, using -- mathematically -- Dirac delta distributions. We propose a multi-Dirac approach and provide explicit expressions for the intensities of the Dirac distributions. We show that two to three well-positioned Dirac points suffice to approximate well a temporally constant but spatially heterogeneous flux distribution of compound over the cell membrane, for a wide range of variation in flux density and diffusivity. The multi-Dirac approach is compared to a single-Dirac approach that was studied in previous work.

Through the use of implicit function theorem techniques and a priori estimates, we construct both spatially periodic and solitary (non-periodic but spatially localized) solutions. The solitary case is substantially more complicated, requiring a delicate analysis in weighted Sobolev spaces.

It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system",AP,AP,1,0
2502.11683v1,Global Solvability for the Compressible Hookean Viscoelastic Fluids with a Free Boundary in Some Classes of Large Data,Fei Jiang; Youyi Zhao,"Recently Jiang-Jiang established a global (in time) existence result for unique strong solutions of the two-dimensional (2D) free-boundary problem of an incompressible Hookean viscoelastic fluid, the rest state of which is defined in a slab, in some classes of large data [28]. In particular, Jiang-Jiang's mathematical result shows that, if the initial free boundary is flat, the way the elastic deformation under the large elasticity coefficient $\kappa$ acts on the free boundary prevents the natural tendency of the fluid to form singularities, even when the initial velocity is properly large. However it is not clear whether their result can be extended to the corresponding 3D case. In this paper, we further find a similar result in the 3D stratified (immiscible) compressible Hookean viscoelastic fluids in an infinite slab with two restrictive conditions: that the elasticity coefficients of two fluids are equal, and that the initial density functions satisfy the asymptotic stability condition in Lagrangian coordinates. These two restrictive conditions in the compressible case contribute us to avoid the essential obstacles that would be faced in the extension of Jiang-Jiang's result from two dimensions to our 3D case. In addition, we can further obtain a new result regarding the vanishing phenomena of the nonlinear interactions of solutions with the fixed initial velocity and the initial zero perturbation deformation. Such a new result roughly presents that the solutions of the problem considered by us can be approximated by the ones of a linear problem for sufficiently large $\kappa$.",AP,AP,1,0

We consider this solver in the setting where sparse solution data is available, e.g. from data measurements or solution observables, and enhance Picard by incorporating the data into the iteration using a continuous data assimilation (CDA) approach. We prove that our approach scales the linear convergence rate by $H^{1/2}$, where $H$ is the characteristic spacing of the measurement locations. This implies that when Picard is converging, CDA will accelerate convergence, and when Picard is not converging, CDA (with enough data) will enable convergence. In the case of noisy data, we prove that the linear convergence rate of the nonlinear residual is similarly scaled by $H^{1/2}$ but the accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the data. Several numerical tests illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including when the data is noisy. These tests show that CDA style nudging adapted to an iteration (instead of a time stepping scheme) enables convergence at much higher $Ra$.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

We study in detail the time continuous limits of these evolutions considering monotonicity as irreversibility constraint and providing a general result, which holds independently of the scheme employed in the incremental problem. In particular, we show that in the steady state regime the limit evolution is simultaneous (in displacement and phase field parameter) and satisfies Griffith's criterion in terms of toughness and phase field energy release rate. In the unsteady regime the limit evolution may instead depend on the adopted scheme and Griffith's criterion may not hold. We prove also the thermodynamical consistency of the monotonicity constraint over the whole evolution, and we study the system of PDEs (actually, a weak variational inequality) in the steady state regime. Technically, the proof employs a suitable reparametrization of the time discrete points, whose Kuratowski limit characterizes the set of steady state propagation.

A classical blow-up/continuation criterion for smooth solutions relies on the control of the Lipschitz norm of the velocity field $u$. Here we show that, for establishing blow-up or continuation of solutions, it is enough to determine a control of $\nabla u$ only along the direction $X=\nabla^\perp\rho$, where $\rho$ represents the density of the fluid. Our results deal with both the subcritical regularity and critical regularity frameworks.

We assume that there are no external forces acting on the coupled system $\mathscr S := \mathscr B +\mathscr L$ and that the only driving mechanism is a prescribed change in shape of $\Omega$ with time. The self-propulsion problem that we would like to address can be thus qualitatively formulated as follows. Suppose that $\mathscr B$ changes its shape in a given time-periodic fashion, namely, $\Omega(t+T) = \Omega(t)$, for some $T > 0$ and all $t \in \mathbb{R}$. Then, find necessary and sufficient conditions on the map $t\mapsto \Omega(t)$ securing that $\mathscr B$ self-propels, that is, $G$ covers any given finite distance in a finite time.

The dynamics of these slender filaments in viscous flows involve intricate interactions between their mechanical properties and hydrodynamic drag. In this paper, considering a 1D, planar, inextensible Euler-Bernoulli rod in a viscous fluid modeled by Resistive Force Theory, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the $N$-link model, a mechanical model, designed to approximate the continuous filament with rigid segments. Then, we prove the convergence of the $N$-link model's solutions towards the solutions to classical elastohydrodynamics equations of a flexible slender rod. This provides an existence result for the limit model, comparable to those by Mori and Ohm [Nonlinearity, 2023], in a different functional context and with different methods. Due to its mechanical foundation, the discrete system satisfies an energy dissipation law, which serves as one of the main ingredients in our proofs.

Recently, in [H.~Gimperlein, M.~Grinfeld, R.~J.~Knops and M.~Slemrod: The least action admissibility principle, arXiv: 2409.07191 (2024)] it was suggested that the least action admissibility principle serves as the desired selection criterion.

We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete to the past and terminate at quiescent, crushing big bang singularities located at $\tau=0$, which are characterised by curvature blow up.

This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curve, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to illustrate the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then illustrate the applications of this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

While finite difference methods have been explored for this PDE, they face limitations in accuracy and stability when handling highly oscillatory inputs. In this work, we introduce two advanced numerical schemes that leverage polynomial representations of boundary conditions through either approximation or interpolation techniques, and rigorously establish the theoretical convergence of the polynomial approximation scheme. Experimental evaluations reveal that our approaches yield improvements of several orders of magnitude in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to traditional finite difference schemes, without increasing computational complexity.

2502.08330v1,Effects of oscillation scales in discrete brittle damage models,Elise Bonhomme,"This paper is concerned with the asymptotic analysis of a sequence of variational models of brittle damage in the context of linearized elasticity in the two-dimensional discrete setting. We consider a discrete version of Francfort and Marigo's brittle damage model, where the total energy is restricted to continuous and piecewise affine displacements; within different regimes where the damaged regions concentrate on vanishingly small sets while the stiffness of the damaged material degenerates to $0$. In this setting, the convergence of the space discretization, the concentration of the damaged regions, and the decay of the elastic properties of the damaged phase all compete simultaneously in non-trivial ways according to the scaling law under consideration. The mesh size turns out to be a crucial feature of the analysis, as it induces a minimal scale of spatial oscillations for admissible displacements. This study was motivated by the numerical investigations performed in [2] on the one hand, where Allaire-Jouve-Van Goethem have shown that forcing the stiffness decay on sets of arbitrarily small measure seems to lead to concentrations phenomena such as in brittle fracture; and by the static analysis performed in [10] on the other hand, where Babadjian-Iurlano-Rindler addressed the rigorous asymptotic analysis of this observation in terms of the $\Gamma$-convergence of the total energies, in the continuous setting in space. Surprisingly, they showed that fracture-type models were not obtained asymptotically, thus raising the question of the dependence of the effective models with respect to the scaling of a spatial discretization in Francfort and Marigo's model.

ZK equation is significant in fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics, and acoustics. ZK equation plays an important role in understanding the behavior of nonlinear, dispersive waves especially in the presence of the magnetic field. Lie symmetry analysis has been applied to the (3+1)-dimensional ZK equation to derive invariant solutions. These solutions reveal how waves retain their shape as they travel, how they interact in space, and the impact of magnetic fields on wave propagation. Using the Lie symmetry, the (3+1) dimensional ZK equation is reduced to various ordinary differential equations. It also concludes with the conservation laws and non-linear self-adjoint ness property.

First we derive H\""{o}lder and Schauder estimates for nonnegative solutions of this equation. Due to the {\em nonlocality} of the master operator, existing results (cf. \cite{ST}) rely on global bounds of the solutions $u$ to control their higher local norms. However, such results are inadequate for blow-up and rescaling analysis aimed at obtaining a priori estimates for solutions to {\em nonlocal } equations on unbounded domains, as the global norms of the rescaled functions may diverge.   This limitation raises to a natural and challenging question:   {\em Can local bounds of solutions replace global bounds to control their higher local norms?}   Here, we provide an affirmative answer to this question for nonnegative solutions. To achieve this, we introduced several new ideas and novel techniques. One of the key innovations is to use a {\em directional perturbation average} to derive an important estimate for the fully fractional heat kernel, as stated in Lemma \ref{key0}. We believe this estimate, along with other new techniques introduced here, will serve as powerful tools in regularity estimates for a wide range of nonlocal equations.   Building on this breakthrough, we employ the blow-up and rescaling arguments to establish a priori estimates for solutions to a broader class of nonlocal equations in unbounded domains, such as $$(\partial_t -\Delta)^{s} u(x,t) = b(x,t) |\nabla_x u (x,t)|^q + f(x, u(x,t))\ \ \mbox{in}\ \ \R^n\times\R.$$ Under appropriate conditions, we prove that all nonnegative solutions, along with their spatial gradients, are uniformly bounded.",AP,AP,1,0

We establish global existence of mild solutions for small data compactly supported by employing energy estimates within suitable Sobolev spaces of the associated homogeneous problem.

This shows that the critical exponent is given by $p_G(1+\mu_0)=1+2/\mu_0$, when $\mu_0\in (0,1]$, where $p_G$ is the Glassey exponent. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first identification of the critical exponent range for this class of equations.

2502.07061v1,Uniqueness of Weak Solutions for Biot-Stokes Interactions,George Avalos; Justin T.

The model comprises a 3D Biot poroelastic system coupled to a 3D incompressible Stokes flow via a 2D interface, where kinematic, stress-matching, and tangential-slip conditions are prescribed. Our previous work provided a construction of weak solutions, these satisfying an associated finite energy inequality. However, several well-established issues related to the dynamic coupling, hinder a direct approach to obtaining uniqueness and continuous dependence. In particular, low regularity of the hyperbolic (Lam\'e) component of the model precludes the use of the solution as a test function, which would yield the necessary a priori estimate. In considering degenerate and non-degenerate cases separately, we utilize two different approaches. In the former, energy estimates are obtained for arbitrary weak solutions through a systematic decoupling of the constituent dynamics, and well-posedness of weak solutions is inferred. In the latter case, an abstract semigroup approach is utilized to obtain uniqueness via a precise characterization of the adjoint of the dynamics operator. The results here can be adapted to other systems of poroelasticity, as well as to the general theory of weak solutions for hyperbolic-parabolic coupled systems.",AP,AP,1,0

Recent experiments have reported the observation of optical branched flows by using an incoherent light source, thus revealing the key role of coherent phase-sensitive effects in the development of incoherent branched flows. By considering the paraxial wave equation as a generic representative model, we elaborate a stochastic theory of both coherent and incoherent branched flows. We derive closed-form equations that determine the evolution of the intensity correlation function, as well as the value and the propagation distance of the maximum of the scintillation index, which characterize the dynamical formation of incoherent branched flows. We report accurate numerical simulations that are found in quantitative agreement with the theory without free parameters.

2502.06625v1,Mitigation of Artifacts in Multistatic & Passive Radar Imaging Using Microlocal Analysis,David McMahon; Clifford J. Nolan,"In the analysis of many synthetic aperture radar (SAR) experiments the possibility of passive background signals being recorded simultaneously and corrupting the image is often overlooked. Our work addresses this by considering the multistatic experiment where two stationary emitters are ""always on"" so there is ""crosstalk"" between their signals. The model for the radar data is given by a Fourier integral operator, and we assume that the data cannot be separated into contributions from individual emitters. Using techniques of microlocal analysis, we show that ""crosstalk"" between emitters leads to artifacts in the image and we determine their locations relative to the scatterers that produced the data.   To combat the harmful effects of crosstalk, we develop methods that allow us to create an image of a region of interest (ROI) that is free from such artifacts. The first method makes use of a carefully designed data acquisition geometry to localise artifacts away from a ROI, and the second is an image processing technique that displaces artifacts away from a ROI. These methods are verified via numerical implementation in MATLAB. The analysis carried out here is valuable in bistatic and multistatic radar experiments, where an unwanted, passive source is also being detected, as well as in passive imaging, where one wishes to produce a high-quality image purely from uncontrolled sources of illumination.",AP,AP,1,0

This way, we demonstrate that gap functions effectively predict the decay rates of defect states. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the Floquet transform with respect to complex quasimomenta.

We construct the gradient flow of the infinite-volume free energy on the space of translation-invariant spin measures, using an adaptation of the variational approach in Wasserstein space pioneered by Jordan, Kinderlehrer, and Otto. We also construct the infinite-volume diffusion corresponding to the so-called overdamped Langevin dynamics of the spins under the effect of the interactions and of thermal agitation.   We show that the trajectories of the gradient flow and of the law of the spins under this diffusion both satisfy, in a weak sense, the same hierarchy of coupled parabolic PDE's, which we interpret as an infinite-volume Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation. We prove regularity of weak solutions and derive an Evolution Variational Inequality for regular solutions, which implies uniqueness. Thus, in particular, the trajectories of the gradient flow coincide with those obtained from the Langevin dynamics.   Concerning the long-time evolution, we check that the free energy is always non-increasing along the flow and that moreover, if the Ricci curvature of the spin space is uniformly positive, then at high enough temperature the dynamics converges exponentially, in free energy and in specific Wasserstein distance, to the unique minimizer of the infinite-volume free energy.",AP,AP,1,0

Previous scattering results for such problems address only the cases with constant coefficients or assume strong variants of the non-trapping condition, stating that all the trajectories of the Hamiltonian flow associated with the operator are escaping to infinity. In contrast, we consider the most general setting, where strong trapping, such as stable closed geodesics, may occur, but we introduce a compactly supported damping term localized in the trapping region, to explore how damping can mitigate the effects of trapping. In addition to the challenges posed by the trapped trajectories, notably the loss of smoothing and of scale-invariant Strichartz estimates, difficulties arise from the damping itself, particularly since the energy is not, a priori, bounded. For $H^{1+\epsilon}$ initial data -- chosen because the local-in-time theory is a priori no better than for 3D unbounded manifolds, where local well-posedness of strong $H^1$ solutions is unavailable -- we establish global existence and scattering in $H^{s}$ for any $0 \leq s <1$ in positive times, the inability to reach $H^1$ being related to the loss of smoothing due to trapping.",AP,AP,1,0

With the help of these estimates, the uniqueness of the position of the intersection point between the shock front and the nozzle boundary could be further established by demonstrating the monotonicity of the solvability condition for the elliptic sub-problem of the subsonic flow behind the shock front.

Starting from a superposition of N stationary transition layers, at a specific time scale for the interface dynamics, we prove that the dynamic solution approaches the superposition of N explicit transition profiles whose centers solve the ODE system with a repulsive force. Notably, this ODE system is identical to the one obtained in the slow motion patterns of the one-dimensional fractional Allen-Cahn equation, where the elastic bulk is assumed to be static. Due to the fully coupled bulk and interface dynamics, new corrector functions with delicate estimates are constructed to stabilize the bulk dynamics and characterize the limiting behavior of the dynamic solution throughout the entire half-plane.",AP,AP,1,0

2502.05860v1,Global Dynamics of Nonlocal Diffusion Systems on Time-Varying Domains,Xiandong Lin; Hailong Ye; Xiao-Qiang Zhao,"We propose a class of nonlocal diffusion systems on time-varying domains, and fully characterize their asymptotic dynamics in the asymptotically fixed, time-periodic and unbounded cases. The kernel is not necessarily symmetric or compactly supported, provoking anisotropic diffusion or convective effects. Due to the nonlocal diffusion on time-varying domains in our systems, some significant challenges arise, such as the lack of regularizing effects of the semigroup generated by the nonlocal operator, as well as the time-dependent inherent coupling structure in kernel. By investigating a general nonautonomous nonlocal diffusion system in the space of bounded and measurable functions, we establish a comprehensive and unified framework to rigorously examine the threshold dynamics of the original system on asymptotically fixed and time-periodic domains. In the case of an asymptotically unbounded domain, we introduce a key auxiliary function to separate vanishing coefficients from nonlocal diffusions. This enables us to construct appropriate sub-solutions and derive the global threshold dynamics via the comparison principle. The findings may be of independent interest and the developed techniques, which do not rely on the existence of the principal eigenvalue, are expected to find further applications in the related nonlocal diffusion problems. We also conduct numerical simulations based on a practical model to illustrate our analytical results.",AP,AP,1,0

When $\mu>0$, due to appearance of the Hardy potential, the equation has singularity at $0\in\mathbb{R}^{N}$ and hence is not translation invariant, so sharp asymptotic estimates near the origin must be involved. First, we establish regularity and the sharp estimates on asymptotic behaviors near the origin and the infinity for any positive solution $u\in D^{1,p}(\R^{N})$ (and $|\nabla u|$) to more general equation $-\triangle_p u - \mu \frac{1}{|x|^p}u^{p-1}=V(x)\frac{1}{|x|^s}u^{p-1}$ with $N\geq2$, $0\leq\mu< \bar{\mu}$, $1<p<N$, $0\leq s < p$ and $0\leq V(x)\in L^\frac{N}{p-s}(\R^N)$. Then, as a consequence, we can apply the method of moving planes to prove that all the nontrivial nonnegative solutions in $D^{1,p}(\R^{N})$ are radially symmetric and strictly radially decreasing about the origin $0\in\mathbb{R}^{N}$. The sharp asymptotic estimates and radial symmetry for more general weighted doubly $D^{1,p}$-critical nonlocal quasi-linear equations were also derived.

Despite its physical importance, the global well-posedness to this system remains completely open. This gap is filled in this article in the three dimensional period box case. We show that any smooth, small initial perturbation of a global Maxwellian satisfying the conservations of mass, momentum and energy leads to a unique global-in-time classical solution with an exponential decay for the whole range of collision potential $r\in (-3,1]$.

The considered energy functional consists of a symmetric exchange interaction, which penalizes spatial variations in magnetization, and a magnetostatic self-energy term that accounts for long-range dipolar interactions. Motivated by the extension of Brown's fundamental theorem on fine ferromagnetic particles to nonlocal settings, we develop a rigorous variational framework in $L^2(\Omega;\mathbb{S}^2)$ under mild assumptions on the interaction kernel \( j \), including symmetry, L\'evy-type integrability, and prescribed singular behavior. For spherical domains, we generalize Browns fundamental results by identifying critical radii $R^*$ and $R^{**}$ that delineate distinct energetic regimes: for \( R \leq R^* \), the uniform magnetization state is energetically preferable (\emph{small-body regime}), whereas for $R \geq R^{**}$, non-uniform magnetization configurations become dominant (\emph{large-body regime}). These transitions are analyzed through Poincar\'e-type inequalities and explicit energy comparisons between uniform and vortex-like magnetization states.   Our results directly connect classical micromagnetic theory and contemporary nonlocal models, providing new insights into domain structure formation in nanoscale magnetism. Furthermore, the mathematical framework developed in this work contributes to advancing theoretical foundations for applications in spintronics and data storage technologies.",AP,AP,1,0

Due to the non-dissipative properties for densities and two different particle paths caused by velocities, the system lacks the usual symmetry structure and is partially dissipative in the sense that the Shizuta-Kawashima condition is violated, which makes it challenging to study its large-time stability. By developing a pure energy method in the framework of Besov spaces, we succeed in constructing a unique global classical solution to the Cauchy problem when the initial data are close to their constant equilibria. Compared to the previous related works, the main novelty lies in that our method is independent of the spectral analysis and does not rely on the $L^1$ smallness of the initial data. Furthermore, if additionally the initial perturbation is bounded in $\dot{B}^{\sigma_0}_{2,\infty}$ type spaces with lower regularity, the optimal time convergence rates are also obtained. In particular, the asymptotic convergence of the non-dissipative components toward their equilibrium states is first characterized.",AP,AP,1,0

A nonlocal notion of indecomposability associated to these perimeters is introduced, and we prove that in both cases it can be characterized solely in terms of the interaction range or horizon $\varepsilon$. Utilizing this, we show that it is possible to uniquely decompose a set into its $\varepsilon$-connected components, establishing a nonlocal analogue of the decomposition theorem of Ambrosio, Caselles, Masnou and Morel. Moreover, the extreme points of the balls induced by the Gagliardo and nonlocal total variation seminorm are identified, which naturally correspond to the two nonlocal perimeters. Surprisingly, while the extreme points in the former case are normalized indicator functions of $\varepsilon$-simple sets, akin to the classical TV-ball, in the latter case they are instead obtained from a nonlocal transformation applied to the extreme points of the TV-ball.

Assuming smoothness for the interface between the subdomains and regularity of the data, the electric field solution of the Maxwell equations possesses an asymptotic expansion in powers of the parameter $\eps=1/ \sqrt{\mu_{r}}$ with profile terms rapidly decaying inside the magnetic conductor. We make explicit the first terms of this expansion.

We establish the uniqueness and existence of bounded Lipschitz Monge solutions to the initial value problem and discuss their equivalence with existing notions of metric viscosity solutions.",AP,AP,1,0
2502.04676v1,Refined regularity for nonlocal elliptic equations and applications,Wenxiong Chen; Congming Li; Leyun Wu; Zhouping Xin,"In this paper, we establish refined regularity estimates for nonnegative solutions to the fractional Poisson equation $$ (-\Delta)^s u(x) =f(x),\,\, x\in B_1(0). $$ Specifically, we have derived H\""{o}lder, Schauder, and Ln-Lipschitz regularity estimates for any nonnegative solution $u,$ provided that only the local $L^\infty$ norm of $u$ is bounded. These estimates stand in sharp contrast to the existing results where the global $L^\infty$ norm of $u$ is required. Our findings indicate that the local values of the solution $u$ and $f$ are sufficient to control the local values of higher order derivatives of $u$. Notably, this makes it possible to establish a priori estimates in unbounded domains by using blowing up and re-scaling argument.   As applications, we derive singularity and decay estimates for solutions to some super-linear nonlocal problems in unbounded domains, and in particular, we obtain a priori estimates for a family of fractional Lane-Emden type equations in $\mathbb{R}^n.$ This is achieved by adopting a different method using auxiliary functions, which is applicable to both local and nonlocal problems.",AP,AP,1,0

We show that with rough initial conditions, the equation is well-posed assuming non-positive curvature with a condition on $\alpha$ similar to that of Riesz kernel-correlated noise in Euclidean space. The argument was made in direct mode, showing that it is possible to bypass Fourier analysis, which was used in all previous work with rough initial conditions. Non-positive curvature was used to overcome a new difficulty introduced by non-uniqueness of geodesics in this setting, which required exploration of global geometry. The well-posedness argument also produces exponentially growing in time upper bounds for the moments. Using the good structure of our noise, we obtain new exponentially growing in time second moment lower bounds for our solutions with bounded initial condition.",AP,AP,1,0

However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of contrastive learning remain incomplete, with many essential guarantees left unaddressed, particularly the realizability assumption concerning neural approximability of an optimal spectral contrastive loss solution. In this work, we overcome these limitations by analyzing the pointwise and spectral consistency of the augmentation graph Laplacian. We establish that, under specific conditions for data generation and graph connectivity, as the augmented dataset size increases, the augmentation graph Laplacian converges to a weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator on the natural data manifold. These consistency results ensure that the graph Laplacian spectrum effectively captures the manifold geometry. Consequently, they give way to a robust framework for establishing neural approximability, directly resolving the realizability assumption in a current paradigm.",AP,AP,1,0

We focus on a system with a singular potential namely logarithmic form and a degenerate mobility function. The singular potential introduces challenges due to the blow up of its derivatives near pure phases, while the degenerate mobility complicates the analysis. Our main result is the separation property, which ensures that the solution eventually stays away from the pure phases.

The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.",AP,AP,1,0

In our study, we address the spatial distribution of the population in a two dimensional bounded domain by extending the temporal SIT model analyzed in [2], thereby obtaining a reaction-diffusion SIT model.

It is remarkable that this relaxed condition can be computed in three different but equivalent ways: 1) using viscosity inequalities, 2) using Godunov fluxes, 3) using Riemann problems.Our result goes beyond uniqueness theory, in the following sense: solutions to two different desired junction conditions $F_0$ and $F_1$ do coincide if $\frak R F_0=\frak R F_1$.",AP,AP,1,0

For elliptic operators we give a geometric evaluation of this characterization. Additionally, for differential operators with a single characteristic direction, like parabolic operators, we give a sufficient geometric condition for the above density to hold. Under mild additional assumptions on $\partial F_1$ and for $F_2=\mathbb{R}^d$ this sufficient conditions is also necessary. As an application of our work, we characterize those open subsets $\Omega$ of the complex plane satisfying $\Omega=\operatorname{int}\overline{\Omega}$ for which the set of holomorphic polynomials are dense in $A^\infty(\Omega)$, under the mild additional hypothesis that $\overline{\Omega}$ satisfies the strong regularity condition.

In dimension $d \le 3$, vanishing Chern classes characterize the topological phases of periodic media that exhibit localized Wannier functions. However, for special symmetries $I$ of the system, such as $C_{2z}T$ (space-time reversal), the existence of a localized set of Wannier functions that is also invariant under this symmetry $I$ may not always exist. In systems with fragile topology, Wannier functions cannot respect both the symmetry $I$ and the localization constraints. Nevertheless, this obstruction can be lifted by adding Chern-trivial line bundles, invariant under the $I$-symmetry. This allows for the construction of localized Wannier functions that respect symmetry. In the last section, we take on a broader perspective and obtain Wannier localization in dimensions $d=2,3$ without symmetry constraints for Chern nontrivial Bloch bundles. For $d=2$, we obtain the Wannier decay with Thouless exponent $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$; for $d=3$, we obtain the decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.",AP,AP,1,0

In the energy space it induces a discontinuity at the origin that breaks the parity symmetry. We treat the $L^2$-subcritical and the $L^2$-critical nonlinearity. For a subcritical nonlinearity we prove the existence and the uniqueness of the Ground State at any mass, namely the positive minimizer of the associated energy among all functions with the same mass. If the mass is larger than an explicit threshold, then there exists another stationary solution, i.e. an excited state, which is positive too. For the critical nonlinearity we prove that Ground States exist only in a specific interval of masses. Furthermore, one branch of excited states exists in a range of masses disjoint from that of the Ground States. For a dipole interaction, i.e. without the Dirac's delta, all Ground States concentrate at the same value of the mass and all excited states concentrate at another value of the mass. Both masses depend on the strength of the dipole interactions. Furthermore, we provide the value of the optimal constant in the Gagliardo-Nirenberg estimate and describe in detail the bifurcation from the unperturbed soliton that gives rise to both branches of stationary states, providing the motivation for the values of the mass that characterize the two branches, in the limit of a dipole interaction of infinite strength.

They are generated by converting a continuous-wave pump laser within an optical microresonator. It has been observed that the interplay of Kerr nonlinearity and dispersion in the microresonator can lead to a stable optical signal consisting of a periodic sequence of highly localized ultra-short pulses, resulting in broad frequency spectrum. The discovery that stable broadband frequency combs can be generated in microresonators has unlocked a wide range of promising applications, particularly in optical communications, spectroscopy and frequency metrology. In its simplest form, the physics in the microresonator is modeled by the Lugiato-Lefever equation, a damped nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation with forcing. In this paper we demonstrate that the Lugiato-Lefever equation indeed supports arbitrarily broad Kerr frequency combs by proving the existence and stability of periodic solutions consisting of any number of well-separated, strongly localized and highly nonlinear pulses on a single periodicity interval. We realize these periodic multiple pulse solutions as concatenations of individual bright cavity solitons by phrasing the problem as a reversible dynamical system and employing results from homoclinic bifurcation theory.

Building on this asymptotic analysis, we develop a simple yet effective numerical algorithm to address ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems aimed at reconstructing coefficient functions that depend solely on spatial or temporal variables. Conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of solutions for both forward and inverse problems are established. The proposed method's effectiveness is validated through numerical experiments, demonstrating high accuracy in reconstructing coefficient functions under varying noise conditions.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

2502.03025v1,Optimal control of the fidelity coefficient in a Cahn-Hilliard image inpainting model,Elena Beretta; Cecilia Cavaterra; Matteo Fornoni; Maurizio Grasselli,"We consider an inpainting model proposed by A. Bertozzi et al., which is based on a Cahn--Hilliard-type equation. This equation describes the evolution of an order parameter $u \in [0,1]$ representing an approximation of the original image which occupies a bounded two-dimensional domain $\Omega$. The given image $g$ is assumed to be damaged in a fixed subdomain $D \subset \Omega$ and the equation is characterized by a linear reaction term of the form $\lambda (u - g)$. Here $\lambda = \lambda_0 \chi_{\Omega \setminus D}$ is the so-called fidelity coefficient, $\lambda_0$ being a strictly positive bounded function. The idea is that, given an initial image $u_0$, $u$ evolves towards $g$ and this process properly diffuses through the boundary of $D$ restoring the damaged image, provided that $\lambda_0$ is large enough. Here, we formulate an optimal control problem based on this fact, namely our cost functional accounts for the magnitude of $\lambda_0$. Assuming a singular potential to assure that $u$ takes its values in $[0,1]$, we first analyse the control-to-state operator and prove the existence of at least one optimal control, establishing the validity of first-order optimality conditions. Then, under suitable assumptions, we demonstrate second-order optimality conditions. All these results depend on the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution, which we obtain thanks to the strict separation property from pure phases.",AP,AP,1,0

Starting from a collection of $N$ nondegenerate primary front solutions with matching periodic end states, we realize multifront solutions near a formal concatenation of these $N$ primary fronts, provided the distances between the front interfaces is sufficiently large. Moreover, we prove that nondegenerate primary pulses are accompanied by periodic pulse solutions of large spatial period. We show that spectral (in)stability properties of the underlying primary fronts or pulses are inherited by the bifurcating multifronts or periodic pulse solutions. The existence and spectral analyses rely on contraction-mapping arguments and Evans-function techniques, leveraging exponential dichotomies to characterize invertibility and Fredholm properties. To demonstrate the applicability of our methods, we analyze the existence and stability of multifronts and periodic pulse solutions in some benchmark models, such as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with periodic potential and a Klausmeier reaction-diffusion-advection system, thereby identifying novel classes of (stable) solutions.

For the first time in this work, the space of test functions $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$ emerges as the natural regularity space for solutions of the eigenproblem associated with $\Delta_{W,V}$. Moreover, these spaces are essential for characterizing the energetic space $H_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$ as a Sobolev-type space. By observing that the Sobolev-type spaces $H_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$ with additional Dirichlet conditions are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we introduce the so-called $W$-Brownian bridges as mean-zero Gaussian processes with associated Cameron-Martin spaces derived from these spaces. This framework allows us to introduce $W$-Brownian motion as a Feller process with a two-parameter semigroup and c\`adl\`ag sample paths, whose jumps are subordinated to the jumps of $W$. We establish a deep connection between $W$-Brownian motion and these Sobolev-type spaces through their associated Cameron-Martin spaces.

However, if we consider domains that have a Neumann-type outflow condition on part of the boundary $\Gamma_N\subset\partial\Omega$, the inf-sup condition cannot be used in this form, since the pressure here comes from $L^2(\Omega)$ and does not necessarily have zero mean value.

The equations are defined on a one-dimensional bounded interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions, continuous initial position and distributional initial velocity. In the first part of this work, we study the corresponding deterministic dynamics and prove that certain neighborhoods of asymptotically stable equilibria are uniformly attracting in the topology of uniform convergence. Then, we consider exit problems for local solutions of the stochastic damped wave equations from bounded domains $D$ of uniform attraction. Using tools from large deviations along with novel controllability results, we obtain logarithmic asymptotics for exit times and exit places, in the vanishing noise limit, that are expressed in terms of the corresponding quasipotential. In doing so, we develop arguments that take into account the lack of both smoothing and exact controllability that are inherent to the problem at hand. Moreover, our exit time results provide asymptotic lower bounds for the mean explosion time of local solutions. We introduce a novel notion of ""regular"" boundary points allowing to avoid the question of boundary smoothness in infinite dimensions and leading to the proof of a large deviations lower bound for the exit place. We illustrate this notion by providing explicit examples for different classes of domains $D$. Conditions under which lower and upper bounds for exit time and exit place logarithmic asymptotic hold, are also presented.

In this paper, we give an answer to this problem in the following form. We give a generalized modulus problem whose solution is the gradient of the $p$-harmonic function for metric measure spaces. Its dual problem is an optimization problem for measures on curves and we show exact duality and the existence of minimizers for this dual problem under appropriate assumptions. When applied to $p$-harmonic functions the minimizers of this dual problem are supported on gradient curves, yielding a natural concept associated to such functions that has yet to be studied. This process defines a natural dual metric current and proves the existence of gradient curves. These insights are then used to construct a counter example answering the old ``sheaf problem'' on metric spaces: in contrast to Euclidean spaces, in general metric spaces being $p$-harmonic is not strictly speaking a local property.",AP,AP,1,0

2502.00786v1,Periodic FPU system: Continuum limit to KdV via regularization and Fourier analysis,Chulkwang Kwak; Changhun Yang,"The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) system, initially introduced by Fermi for numerical simulations, models vibrating chains with fixed endpoints, where particles interact weakly, nonlinearly with their nearest neighbors. Contrary to the anticipated ergodic behavior, the simulation revealed nearly periodic (quasi-periodic) motion of the solutions, a phenomenon later referred to as the FPU paradox. A partial but remarkable explanation was provided by Zabusky and Kruskal [36], who formally derived the continuum limit of the FPU system, connecting it to the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. This formal derivation was later rigorously justified by Bambusi and Ponno [4].   In this paper, we revisit the problem studied in [4], specifically focusing on the continuum limit of the periodic FPU system for a broader class of initial data, as the number of particles N tends to infinity within a fixed domain. Unlike the non-periodic case discussed in [15], periodic FPU solutions lack a (local) smoothing effect, posing a significant challenge in controlling one derivative in the nonlinearity. This control is crucial not only for proving the (uniform in N) well-posedness for rough data but also for deriving the continuum limit. The main strategies to resolve this issue involve deriving L4-Strichartz estimates for FPU solutions, analogous to those previously derived for KdV solutions in [7], and regularizing the system via the normal form method introduced in [1].",AP,AP,1,0
2502.00720v1,Singular and regular analysis for the free boundaries of two-phase inviscid fluids in gravity field,Lili Du; Feng Ji,"In this paper, we consider a free boundary problem of two-phase inviscid incompressible fluid in gravity field. The presence of the gravity field induces novel phenomena that there might be some stagnation points on free surface of the two-phase flow, where the velocity field of the fluid vanishes. From the mathematical point of view, the gradient of the stream function degenerates near the stagnation point, leading to singular behaviors on the free surface. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the singularity and regularity of the two-phase free surface, considering their mutual interaction between the two incompressible fluids in two dimensions. More precisely, if the two fluids meet locally at a single point, referred to as the possible two-phase stagnation point, we demonstrate that the singular side of the two-phase free surface exhibits a symmetric Stokes singular profile, while the regular side near this point maintains the $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity. On the other hand, if the free surfaces of the two fluids stick together and have non-trivial overlapping common boundary at the stagnation point, then the interaction between the two fluids will break the symmetry of the Stokes corner profile, which is attached to the $C^{1,\alpha}$ regular free surface on the other side. As a byproduct of our analysis, it's shown that the velocity field for the two fluids cannot vanish simultaneously on the two-phase free boundary.   Our results generalize the significant works on the Stokes conjecture in [V$\check{a}$rv$\check{a}$ruc$\check{a}$-Weiss, Acta Math., 206, (2011)] for one-phase gravity water wave, and on regular results on the free boundaries in [De Philippis-Spolaor-Velichkov, Invent.

The system is first linearized around a non-constant steady state and then reformulated into a coupled system by introducing a new variable to handle the integral term. Due to the presence of variable coefficients in the linear operator, the rigorous computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions becomes infeasible. Therefore, we concentrate on the principal operator, and investigate its analyticity and spectral properties. We establish a feedback stabilization result for the principal system, ensuring a specific decay rate. Using the feedback operator derived from this analysis, we extend the approach to the full system, constructing a closed-loop system.

We employ the Leray projection and a nonstandard mollification technique to demonstrate that the quotient between the imaginary and real parts of the analyticity radius remains unrestricted, thus extending the analyticity persistence results beyond traditional constraints. Our methodology combines analytic-Sobolev estimates with an iterative scheme which is nonstandard in the Cauchy-Kowalevskaya framework, ensuring rigorous control over the evolution of the solution.

Through the analytical results and case studies alongside numerical simulations, we find that the initial mass of the invasive prey species, capture rates of prey species, and the predator's mortality rate are all important factors determining the success/failure of invasions and the species coexistence/extinction. The global dynamics can be completely classified for the Holling type I functional response function, but can only be partially determined for the Holling type II functional response function. For the Holling type I response function, we find that whether the invasive prey species can successfully invade to promote the predator-mediated apparent competition is entirely determined by the capture rates of prey species. If the Holling type II response function is applied, then the dynamics are more complicated. First, if two prey species have the same ecological characteristics, then the initial mass of the invasive prey species is the key factor determining the success/failure of the invasion and hence the effect of the predator-mediated apparent competition. Whereas if two prey species have different ecological characteristics, say different capture rates, then the success of the invasion no longer depends on the initial mass of the invasive prey species, but on the capture rates. In all cases, if the invasion succeeds, then the predator-mediated apparent competition's effectiveness essentially depends on the predator's mortality rate.",AP,AP,1,0

2502.00210v1,Semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes revisited,Yannis Angelopoulos; Ryan Unger,"We revisit global existence and decay for small-data solutions of semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole backgrounds satisfying the classical null condition, a problem which was previously addressed by the first author in joint work with Aretakis and Gajic (Ann. of PDE, 2020). In this paper, we develop a new approach based on propagating a significantly weaker set of estimates, which allows for a simpler and more streamlined proof. Our proof does not require tracking sharp estimates for the solution in the near-horizon region, which means that it is compatible with, but does not imply, the non-decay and growth hierarchy of derivatives of the solution along the event horizon expected from the Aretakis instability. In particular, this approach is in principle compatible with other settings where stronger horizon instabilities are expected, such as nonlinear charged scalar fields on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om, or nonlinear waves on extremal Kerr. We also sketch how our proof applies to semilinear problems on spacetimes settling down to extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om, such as those constructed in our joint work with Kehle (arXiv:2410.16234, 2024).",AP,AP,1,0

Historically, there are two approaches to defining the mass in the asymptotically hyperbolic setting: the mass aspect function of Wang defined on the conformal boundary at infinity, and the mass functional of Chru\'sciel and Herzlich which may be thought of as the closest asymptotically hyperbolic analogue of the ADM mass. In this paper we unify these two approaches by introducing an ADM-style definition of the mass aspect function that applies to a broad range of asymptotics and in very low regularity. Additionally, we show that the mass aspect function can be computed using the Ricci tensor. Finally, we demonstrate that this function exhibits favorable covariance properties under changes of charts at infinity, which includes a proof of the asymptotic rigidity of hyperbolic space in the context of weakly regular metrics.",AP,AP,1,0

First, we motivate and review a new distributional notion of the d'Alembertian from mathematical relativity, more precisely, a nonlinear $p$-version thereof, where $p$ is a nonzero number less than one. This operator comes from natural Lagrangian actions introduced relatively recently. Unlike its classical linear yet hyperbolic counterpart, it is nonlinear yet has elliptic characteristics. Second, we describe recent comparison estimates for the $p$-d'Alembertian of Lorentz distance functions (notably a point or a spacelike hypersurface). Their new contribution implied by prior works on optimal transport through spacetime is a control of the timelike cut locus. Third, we illustrate exact representation formulas for these $p$-d'Alembertians employing methods from convex geometry. Fourth, several applications and open problems are presented.",AP,AP,1,0

Our approach relies on a regularization-approximation scheme which employs domain perforation, very fine blow-up procedures and a new Liouville theorem in the perforated space, of independent interest. Our theory extends to inhomogeneous conormal boundary conditions, to the case of suitably smooth curved manifolds and also applies - whenever $a+n<2$ - to solutions with prescribed homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition at $\Sigma_0$ by a boundary Harnack type principle.

Our key focus is on the existence of a slow manifold on the PDE level, which is a crucial tool from the geometric singular perturbation theory allowing the reduction of the system to a lower dimensional slowly evolving equation. In particular, we use a projection approach based upon a Sturm- Liouville eigenbasis to convert the Fokker-Planck PDE to an infinite system of PDEs that can be truncated/approximated to any order. Based upon this truncation, we can employ the recently developed theory for geometric singular perturbation theory for slow manifolds for infinite-dimensional evolution equations.

As applications, we first establish the finite atomic characterization of $H^p_W$, then using it we give a criterion on the boundedness of sublinear operators from $H^p_W$ to any $\gamma$-quasi-Banach space, and finally applying this criterion we further obtain the boundedness of Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on $H^p_W$. The main novelty of these results lies in that the aforementioned maximal functions related to reducing operators are new even in the scalar weight case and we characterize these matrix-weighted Hardy spaces by a fresh and natural variant of classical weighted atoms via first establishing a Calder\'on--Zygmund decomposition which is also new even in the scalar weight case.",AP,AP,1,0

Namely, for $1<\alpha\le \frac32$ the non-uniqueness is due to the fact that the initial data of the call option are outside the T\""acklind class, and for $\alpha> \frac32$ it is due to the absence boundary condition for $x=\infty$.",AP,AP,1,0

The non-local operator $\operatorname{div}^{\Phi}$ applies to a general non-monotone flux $\mathbf{F}$, and is constructed by decomposing the flux into monotone components according to wave speeds determined by $\mathbf{F}'$. Each monotone component is then consistently subjected to a non-local derivative operator that utilizes an anisotropic kernel supported on the ""correct"" half of the real axis. We establish well-posedness, derive a priori and entropy estimates, and provide an explicit continuous dependence result on the kernel. This stability result is robust with respect to the ""size"" of the kernel, allowing us to specify $\Phi$ as a Dirac delta $\delta_0$ to recover entropy solutions of the local conservation law $\partial_t u = \operatorname{div} \mathbf{F}(u)$ (with an error estimate).

2501.18322v1,A Unified Perspective on the Dynamics of Deep Transformers,Valérie Castin; Pierre Ablin; José Antonio Carrillo; Gabriel Peyré,"Transformers, which are state-of-the-art in most machine learning tasks, represent the data as sequences of vectors called tokens. This representation is then exploited by the attention function, which learns dependencies between tokens and is key to the success of Transformers. However, the iterative application of attention across layers induces complex dynamics that remain to be fully understood. To analyze these dynamics, we identify each input sequence with a probability measure and model its evolution as a Vlasov equation called Transformer PDE, whose velocity field is non-linear in the probability measure. Our first set of contributions focuses on compactly supported initial data. We show the Transformer PDE is well-posed and is the mean-field limit of an interacting particle system, thus generalizing and extending previous analysis to several variants of self-attention: multi-head attention, L2 attention, Sinkhorn attention, Sigmoid attention, and masked attention--leveraging a conditional Wasserstein framework. In a second set of contributions, we are the first to study non-compactly supported initial conditions, by focusing on Gaussian initial data. Again for different types of attention, we show that the Transformer PDE preserves the space of Gaussian measures, which allows us to analyze the Gaussian case theoretically and numerically to identify typical behaviors. This Gaussian analysis captures the evolution of data anisotropy through a deep Transformer. In particular, we highlight a clustering phenomenon that parallels previous results in the non-normalized discrete case.",AP,AP,1,0

Building on topological concepts adapted to VMO maps, such as homotopy and the degree of continuous maps, it introduces and analyzes extendability properties, focusing on the notions of $\ell$-extendability and its generalization, $(\ell, e)$-extendability.   We rely on Fuglede maps, providing a robust setting for handling compositions with Sobolev maps. Several constructions -- including opening, thickening, adaptive smoothing, and shrinking -- are carefully integrated into a unified approach that combines homotopical techniques with precise quantitative estimates.   Our main results establish that a Sobolev map $u \in W^{k, p}$ defined on a compact manifold of dimension $m > kp$ can be approximated by smooth maps if and only if $u$ is $(\lfloor kp \rfloor, e)$-extendable with $e = m$.

Simultaneous saturation is a framework for controlling the size of a set where each element of the set is large. In this paper we apply this framework to multilinear restriction type estimates. Here the elements of the set are $Tf(p)$ where $T$ is an multilinear oscillatory integral operator. Controlling the size of the set where $Tf(p)$ is large allows us to obtain efficient $L^{p}$ estimates for the operator $T$. From this perspective we produce a new and independent of Bennett-Carbery-Tao \cite{BCT} proof of the multilinear restriction theorem. Further we then establish new results on multilinear models for the Bochner-Riesz problem that allow parameter dependent degeneration of the transversality condition.",AP,AP,1,0

The optimal scattering control of the spider diffusion at the junction point is governed by an appropriate and highly non-trivial condition of the Kirchhoff Law type, involving an optimal diffraction probability measure selected from the own local time of the spider process at the vertex. In this work, we prove first the weak dynamic programming principle in the spirit of [32], adapted to the new class of spider diffusion introduced recently in [37]-[38]. Thereafter, we show that the value function of the problem is characterized uniquely in terms of a Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) system posed on a star-shaped network, having a new boundary condition at the vertex called : non linear local-time Kirchhoff's transmission. The key main point is to use the recent comparison theorem obtained in [40], that has significantly unlocked the study of this type of problem. We conclude by discussing the formulation of stochastic scattering control problems, where there is no dependency w.r.t. the local-time variable, for which their well-posedness appear as a simpler consequence of the results of this work and the advances contained in [40].",AP,AP,1,0

An important progress has been made in [5] where functional inequalities are obtained for non-explicit steady states of kinetic equations under rather general conditions.

2501.17990v1,On the removal of the barotropic condition in helicity studies of the compressible Euler and ideal compressible MHD equations,Daniel W. Boutros; John D. Gibbon,"The helicity is a topological conserved quantity of the Euler equations which imposes significant constraints on the dynamics of vortex lines. In the compressible setting the conservation law only holds under the assumption that the pressure is barotropic. We show that by introducing a new definition of helicity density $h_{\rho}=(\rho\textbf{u})\cdot\mbox{curl}\,(\rho\textbf{u})$ this assumption on the pressure can be removed, although $\int_V h_{\rho}dV$ is no longer conserved. However, we show for the non-barotropic compressible Euler equations that the new helicity density $h_{\rho}$ obeys an entropy-type relation (in the sense of hyperbolic conservation laws) whose flux $\textbf{J}_{\rho}$ contains all the pressure terms and whose source involves the potential vorticity $q = \omega \cdot \nabla \rho$. Therefore the rate of change of $\int_V h_{\rho}dV$ no longer depends on the pressure and is easier to analyse, as it only depends on the potential vorticity and kinetic energy as well as $\mbox{div}\,\textbf{u}$. This result also carries over to the inhomogeneous incompressible Euler equations for which the potential vorticity $q$ is a material constant. Therefore $q$ is bounded by its initial value $q_{0}=q(\textbf{x},\,0)$, which enables us to define an inverse resolution length scale $\lambda_{H}^{-1}$ whose upper bound is found to be proportional to $\|q_{0}\|_{\infty}^{2/7}$. In a similar manner, we also introduce a new cross-helicity density for the ideal non-barotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations.",AP,AP,1,0

A celebrated result of Cheng and Yau gives gradient bounds on manifolds with Ricci curvature $\geq 0$. The Cheng-Yau bound is not sharp, but there is a gradient sharp estimate. To explain this, a Green's function $u$ on a manifold can be used to define a regularized distance $b= u^{\frac{1}{2-n}}$ to the pole. On $\bf{R}^n$, the level sets of $b$ are spheres and $|\nabla b|=1$. If $\text{Ric} \geq 0$, then [C3] proved the sharp gradient estimate $|\nabla b| \leq 1$. We show that the average of $|\nabla b|$ is $\leq 1$ on a three manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature.

In the latter, shearing resp. rotational inertial waves give rise to mixing and dispersive effects, which are relevant for distinct dynamical realms.

More precisely, in a regular regime $d<3\alpha$, one can construct and normalise this measure, and obtain a measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Gaussian free field $\mu$. At $d=3\alpha$, the behaviour depends on the size $|\sigma|$ of the nonlinearity: for $|\sigma|\ll1$, the measure exists, but is singular with respect to $\mu$, whereas for $|\sigma|\gg1$, the measure is not normalisable.

2501.17503v1,The moving contact line problem for the $2D$ nonlinear shallow water equations,Tatsuo Iguchi; David Lannes,"We consider the initial value problem for a nonlinear shallow water model in horizontal dimension d = 2 and in the presence of a fixed partially immersed solid body on the water surface. We assume that the bottom of the solid body is the graph of a smooth function and part of it is in contact with the water. As a result, we have a contact line where the solid body, the water, and the air meet. In our setting of the problem, the projection of the contact line on the horizontal plane moves freely due to the motion of the water surface even if the solid body is fixed. This wave-structure interaction problem reduces to an initial boundary value problem for the nonlinear shallow water equations in an exterior domain with a free boundary, which is the projection of the contact line. The objective of this paper is to derive a priori energy estimates locally in time for solutions at the quasilinear regularity threshold under assumptions that the initial flow is irrotational and subcritical and that the initial water surface is transversal to the bottom of the solid body at the contact line. The key ingredients of the proof are the weak dissipativity of the system, the introduction of second order Alinhac good unknowns associated with a regularizing diffeomorphism, and a new type of hidden boundary regularity for the nonlinear shallow water equations. This last point is crucial to control the regularity of the contact line; it is obtained by combining the use of the characteristic fields related to the eigenvalues of the boundary matrix together with Rellich type identities.",AP,AP,1,0

2501.17497v1,Uniqueness of Dirac-harmonic maps from a compact surface with boundary,Jürgen Jost; Jingyong Zhu,"As a commutative version of the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model, Dirac-harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces were introduced fifteen years ago. They are critical points of an unbounded conformally invariant functional involving two fields, a map from a Riemann surface into a Riemannian manifold and a section of a Dirac bundle which is the usual spinor bundle twisted with the pull-back of the tangent bundle of the target by the map. As solutions to a coupled nonlinear elliptic system, the existence and regularity theory of Dirac-harmonic maps has already received much attention, while the general uniqueness theory has not been established yet. For uncoupled Dirac-harmonic maps, the map components are harmonic maps. Since the uniqueness theory of harmonic maps from a compact surface with boundary is known, it is sufficient to consider the uniqueness of the spinor components, which are solutions to the corresponding boundary value problems for a nonlinear Dirac equation. In particular, when the map components belong to $W^{1,p}$ with $p>2$, the spinor components are uniquely determined by boundary values and map components. For coupled Dirac-harmonic maps, the map components are not harmonic maps. So the uniqueness problem is more difficult to solve. In this paper, we study the uniqueness problem on a compact surface with boundary. More precisely, we prove the energy convexity for weakly Dirac-harmonic maps from the unit disk with small energy. This yields the first uniqueness result about Dirac-harmonic maps from a surface conformal to the unit disk with small energy and arbitrary boundary values.",AP,AP,1,0

Moreover, the PDE is posed in an infinite waveguide geometry $\Omega=\omega\times\mathbb{R}$ and not on a bounded domain. For our proof it is essential that the potentials are time-independent as a key tool in this work are pointwise estimates for the Radon transform of the vector potential $\mathcal{A}=(A_0,\mathrm{i} A)$ and external potential $\Phi$.

As computational power grows, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have led to significant improvements in modeling physical processes described by differential equations.

In response, we propose a novel approach, stiff transfer learning for physics-informed neural networks (STL-PINNs), to effectively tackle stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). Our methodology involves training a Multi-Head-PINN in a low-stiff regime, and obtaining the final solution in a high stiff regime by transfer learning. This addresses the failure modes related to stiffness in PINNs while maintaining computational efficiency by computing ""one-shot"" solutions. The proposed approach demonstrates superior accuracy and speed compared to PINNs-based methods, as well as comparable computational efficiency with implicit numerical methods in solving stiff-parameterized linear and polynomial nonlinear ODEs and PDEs under stiff conditions.

First, we discover, in our setting, a (previously unknown) invariant CR submanifold $\Sigma$ in $M$ of hypersurface type, which we call the central submanifold. We prove that the analytic regularizability of $M$ is equivalent to that of the associated CR manifold $\Sigma$. Furthermore, as a byproduct of our construction, we show that the central manifold construction reduces the whole (smooth or analytic) equivalence problem for nondegenerate structures with the Levi positivity condition to that of the associated central manifolds, i.e. to CR geometry.   Second, we make use of a classical construction due to Marson and show that sufficient for the analytic regularizability of $M$ is the analytic regularizability of the CR manifold $\tilde M$ associated with $M$ in the sense of Marson.

For this class, we demonstrate super-enhanced dissipation, characterized by energy decay rates faster than those observed in autonomous cases (e.g., when $\xi \equiv 1$, as in Coti Zelati and Gallay (2023)). Additionally, we explore enhanced dissipation in the context of intermittent flows, where the velocity fields may be switched on and off over time. In these cases, the dissipation rates are comparable to those of autonomous flows but with modified constants. To illustrate our results, we analyse two prototypical intermittent flows: one that exhibits a gradual turn-on and turn-off phase, and another that undergoes a significant acceleration following a slow initial activation phase. For the second, we derive the corresponding dissipation rate using a gluing argument. Both results are achieved through the application of the hypocoercivity framework (\`a la Bedrossian and Coti Zelati (2017)), adapted to an augmented functional with time-dependent weights. These weights are designed to dynamically counteract the potential growth of $\xi$, ensuring robust estimates for the energy decay.",AP,AP,1,0

This class includes in particular the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations and more generally 1D linear infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation as well as coupled systems. It is known, that for the Timoshenko beam models internal well-posedness implies well-posedness of the overall system. By means of an example we show that this is not true for the Euler-Bernoulli beam models. An easy verifiable equivalent condition for well-posedness of the overall system will be presented. We will conclude the paper by applying the obtained results to several Euler-Bernoulli beam models.",AP,AP,1,0

For initial data under the form of a single coherent state, we identify the notion of criticality as far as the nonlinear coupling constant is concerned, in the semiclassical limit. In the critical case, we prove a general error estimate, and improve it in the case of initial Gaussian profiles. In this critical case, when the initial datum is the sum of two Gaussian coherent states with different centers in phase space, we prove a nonlinear superposition principle.",AP,AP,1,0

2501.16775v1,Slow Manifolds for PDE with Fast Reactions and Small Cross Diffusion,Laurent Desvillettes; Christian Kuehn; Jan-Eric Sulzbach; Bao Quoc Tang; Bao-Ngoc Tran,"Multiple time scales problems are investigated by combining geometrical and analytical approaches. More precisely, for fast-slow reaction-diffusion systems, we first prove the existence of slow manifolds for the abstract problem under the assumption that cross diffusion is small. This is done by extending the Fenichel theory to an infinite dimensional setting, where a main idea is to introduce a suitable space splitting corresponding to a small parameter, which controls additional fast contributions of the slow variable. These results require a strong convergence in $L^\infty(0,T;H^2(\Omega))$, which is the subtle analytical issue in fast reaction problems in comparison to previous works. By considering a nonlinear fast reversible reaction in one dimension, we successfully prove this convergence and therefore obtain the slow manifold for a PDE with fast reactions. Moreover, the obtained convergence also shows the influence of the cross diffusion term and illuminates the role of the initial layer. Explicit approximations of the slow manifold are also carried out in the case of linear systems.",AP,AP,1,0
2503.22652v1,Residual-based Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration for sparse Hermitian eigenvalue problems tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products,Nikhil Kodali; Kartick Ramakrishnan; Phani Motamarri,"Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration (ChFSI) has been widely adopted for computing a small subset of extreme eigenvalues in large sparse matrices. This work introduces a residual-based reformulation of ChFSI, referred to as R-ChFSI, designed to accommodate inexact matrix-vector products while maintaining robust convergence properties. By reformulating the traditional Chebyshev recurrence to operate on residuals rather than eigenvector estimates, the R-ChFSI approach effectively suppresses the errors made in matrix-vector products, improving the convergence behaviour for both standard and generalized eigenproblems. This ability of R-ChFSI to be tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products allows one to incorporate approximate inverses for large-scale generalized eigenproblems, making the method particularly attractive where exact matrix factorizations or iterative methods become computationally expensive for evaluating inverses. It also allows us to compute the matrix-vector products in lower-precision arithmetic allowing us to leverage modern hardware accelerators. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that R-ChFSI achieves desired residual tolerances while leveraging low-precision arithmetic. For problems with millions of degrees of freedom and thousands of eigenvalues, R-ChFSI attains final residual norms in the range of 10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-14}$, even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly outperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings. In generalized eigenproblems, where approximate inverses are used, R-ChFSI achieves residual tolerances up to ten orders of magnitude lower, demonstrating its robustness to approximation errors. Finally, R-ChFSI provides a scalable and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale eigenproblems in high-performance computing environments.",NA,NA,0,1

Where existing approaches search for simulations violating a formal specification or maximizing a notion of coverage, in this work we propose a new goal for testing: to discover unknown rare behaviors by examining discrete mode sequences. We assume a CPS simulator outputs mode information, and strive to explore the sequences of modes produced by varying the initial state or time-varying uncertainties. We hypothesize that rare mode sequences are often the most interesting to a designer, and we develop two accelerated sampling algorithms that speed up the process of finding such sequences. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, ranging from synthetic examples to Simulink diagrams of a CPS, demonstrating in some cases a speedup of over 100x compared with a random sampling strategy.",NA,NA,0,1

Acebrón; José Monteiro,"Many scientific applications require the evaluation of the action of the matrix function over a vector and the most common methods for this task are those based on the Krylov subspace. Since the orthogonalization cost and memory requirement can quickly become overwhelming as the basis grows, the Krylov method is often restarted after a few iterations. This paper proposes a new acceleration technique for restarted Krylov methods based on randomization. The numerical experiments show that the randomized method greatly outperforms the classical approach with the same level of accuracy. In fact, randomization can actually improve the convergence rate of restarted methods in some cases. The paper also compares the performance and stability of the randomized methods proposed so far for solving very large finite element problems, complementing the numerical analyses from previous studies.",NA,NA,0,1

For the Schr\""odinger equation we analyze the exponential-type scheme proposed by Ostermann and Schratz in 2018, whereas in the wave case we treat the corrected Lie splitting proposed by Li, Schratz, and Zivcovich in 2023. We show that the integrators converge with their full order of one and two, respectively. In this situation only fractional convergence rates were previously known. The crucial ingredients in the proofs are known space-time bounds for the solutions to the corresponding linear problems. More precisely, in the Schr\""odinger case we use the $L^4$ Strichartz inequality, and for the wave equation a null form estimate. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a null form estimate is exploited in numerical analysis. We apply the estimates for continuous time, thus avoiding potential losses resulting from discrete-time estimates.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

The solver employs a low order Shortley-Weller multigrid method to precondition a high order matrix-free Krylov subspace solver. The matrix-free approach enables full compatibility with high order IIM discretizations of boundary and interface conditions, as well as high order wavelet-adapted multiresolution grids. Through verification and analysis on 2D domains, we demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to provide high order accurate results to Laplace and Poisson problems with Dirichlet, Neumann, and/or interface jump boundary conditions, all effectively preconditioned using the multigrid method. We further show that the proposed method is able to efficiently solve high order discretizations of Laplace and Poisson problems on complex 3D domains using thousands of compute cores and on multiresolution grids. To our knowledge, this work presents the largest problem sizes tackled with high order immersed methods applied to elliptic partial differential equations, and the first high order results on 3D multiresolution adaptive grids.

Hendy,"The study of parametric differential equations plays a crucial role in weather forecasting and epidemiological modeling. These phenomena are better represented using fractional derivatives due to their inherent memory or hereditary effects. This paper introduces a novel scientific machine learning approach for solving parametric time-fractional differential equations by combining traditional spectral methods with neural networks. Instead of relying on automatic differentiation techniques, commonly used in traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we propose a more efficient global discretization method based on Legendre polynomials. This approach eliminates the need to simulate the parametric fractional differential equations across multiple parameter values. By applying the Legendre-Galerkin weak formulation to the differential equation, we construct a loss function for training the neural network. The trial solutions are represented as linear combinations of Legendre polynomials, with the coefficients learned by the neural network. The convergence of this method is theoretically established, and the theoretical results are validated through numerical experiments on several well-known differential equations.",NA,NA,0,1

2503.22297v1,A posteriori error estimates for the finite element discretization of second-order PDEs set in unbounded domains,T. Chaumont-Frelet,"We consider second-order PDE problems set in unbounded domains and discretized by Lagrange finite elements on a finite mesh, thus introducing an artificial boundary in the discretization. Specifically, we consider the reaction diffusion equation as well as Helmholtz problems in waveguides with perfectly matched layers. The usual procedure to deal with such problems is to first consider a modeling error due to the introduction of the artificial boundary, and estimate the remaining discretization error with a standard a posteriori technique. A shortcoming of this method, however, is that it is typically hard to obtain sharp bounds on the modeling error. In this work, we propose a new technique that allows to control the whole error by an a posteriori error estimator. Specifically, we propose a flux-equilibrated estimator that is slightly modified to handle the truncation boundary. For the reaction diffusion equation, we obtain fully-computable guaranteed error bounds, and the estimator is locally efficient and polynomial-degree-robust provided that the elements touching the truncation boundary are not too refined. This last condition may be seen as an extension of the notion of shape-regularity of the mesh, and does not prevent the design of efficient adaptive algorithms. For the Helmholtz problem, as usual, these statements remain valid if the mesh is sufficiently refined. Our theoretical findings are completed with numerical examples which indicate that the estimator is suited to drive optimal adaptive mesh refinements.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

These can be viewed as nearness measures between a preconditioner and a given matrix, and we show under which conditions these two functions coincide. We also give examples of constraint sets over which it is equivalent to minimise these two objectives. We focus on preconditioners that are the sum of a positive definite and low-rank matrix, which were developed in a previous work. These were constructed as minimisers of the aforementioned divergence, and we show that they are only a constant scaling from also minimising Kaporin's condition number.

This method, as well as Cramer and Jacobi, is widely used in education and engineering, but there is a theoretical gap when we want to solve less restricted systems, or even non-square or non-exact systems of equation. Here, the solution goes through the use of numerical systems, such as the minimization theories or the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. In this paper we fill this gap with a global analytical iterative formulation that is capable to reach the solutions obtained with the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and the minimization methodologies, but that analytically lies to the solutions of Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, or Cramer when the system is simplified.",NA,NA,0,1

We consider two distinct settings. In the first, the coefficients and test function are irregular, but the diffusion coefficient remains non-degenerate. Leveraging the smoothing properties of the underlying heat kernel, we establish the strong and weak convergence rates of the scheme in terms of the number of particles N and the mesh size h. In the second setting, where both the coefficients and the test function are smooth, we demonstrate that the weak error rate at the level of the semigroup is optimal, achieving an error of order N -1 + h.",NA,NA,0,1

The complex geometric domain is divided by a uniform Cartesian grid, resulting in challenge in boundary treatment. The proposed ILW boundary treatment could provide high order approximations of both solution values and spatial derivatives at ghost points outside the computational domain. Distinct from existing ILW approaches, our boundary treatment constructs the extrapolation via optimized through a least squares formulation, coupled with the spatial derivatives at the boundary obtained via the ILW procedure.

2503.21618v1,A shifted Laplace rational filter for large-scale eigenvalue problems,Biyi Wang; Karl Meerbergen; Raf Vandebril; Hengbin An; Zeyao Mo,"We present a rational filter for computing all eigenvalues of a symmetric definite eigenvalue problem lying in an interval on the real axis. The linear systems arising from the filter embedded in the subspace iteration framework, are solved via a preconditioned Krylov method.   The choice of the poles of the filter is based on two criteria. On the one hand, the filter should enhance the eigenvalues in the interval of interest, which suggests that the poles should be chosen close to or in the interval. On the other hand, the choice of poles has an important impact on the convergence speed of the iterative method. For the solution of problems arising from vibrations, the two criteria contradict each other, since fast convergence of the eigensolver requires poles to be in or close to the interval, whereas the iterative linear system solver becomes cheaper when the poles lie further away from the eigenvalues. In the paper, we propose a selection of poles inspired by the shifted Laplace preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation.   We show numerical experiments from finite element models of vibrations. We compare the shifted Laplace rational filter with rational filters based on quadrature rules for contour integration.",NA,NA,0,1

CDA methods are typically employed to recover the original system when initial data or viscosity coefficients are unknown, by incorporating a feedback control term generated by observational data over a time period. In this study, based on a regularized form derived from the variational inequalities of the Navier-Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions, we first investigate the classical CDA problem when initial data is absent. After establishing the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solution, we prove its exponential convergence with respect to the time. Additionally, we extend the CDA to address the problem of missing viscosity coefficients and analyze its convergence order, too. Furthermore, utilizing the predictive capabilities of partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs) for time-dependent problems, we propose a novel CDA by replacing observational data with predictions got by pETNNs.

2503.21078v1,Sub-ODEs Simplify Taylor Series Algorithms for Ordinary Differential Equations,Nedialko S. Nedialkov; John D. Pryce,"A Taylor method for solving an ordinary differential equation initial-value problem $\dot x = f(t,x)$, $x(t_0) = x_0$, computes the Taylor series (TS) of the solution at the current point, truncated to some order, and then advances to the next point by summing the TS with a suitable step size.   A standard ODE method (e.g. Runge-Kutta) treats function $f$ as a black box, but a Taylor solver requires $f$ to be preprocessed into a code-list of elementary operations that it interprets as operations on (truncated) TS.   The trade-off for this extra work includes arbitrary order, typically enabling much larger step sizes.   For a standard function, such as $\exp$, this means evaluating $v(t)=\exp(u(t))$, where $u(t),v(t)$ are TS.   The sub-ODE method applies the ODE $d v/d u=v$, obeyed by $v=\exp(u)$, to in-line this operation as $\dot v=v\dot u$.   This gives economy of implementation: each function that satisfies a simple ODE goes into the ""Taylor library"" with a few lines of code--not needing a separate recurrence relation, which is the typical approach.   Mathematically, however, the use of sub-ODEs generally transforms the original ODE into a differential-algebraic system, making it nontrivial to ensure a sound system of recurrences for Taylor coefficients.   We prove that, regardless of how many sub-ODEs are incorporated into $f$, this approach guarantees a sound system.   We introduce our sub-ODE-based Matlab ODE solver and show that its performance compares favorably with solvers from the Matlab ODE suite.",NA,NA,0,1

Despite this, there is still significant debate about the role of various underlying stochastic processes in stabilizing a unique structure for data learning and prediction. One of such obstacles to the theoretical and numerical study of machine intelligent systems is the curse of dimensionality and the sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions. In general, this curse prevents efficient description of states, providing a significant complexity barrier for the system to be efficiently described and studied. In this strand of research, direct treatment and description of such abstract notions of learning theory in terms of quantum information be one of the most favorable candidates. Hence, the subject matter of these articles is devoted to problems of design, adaptation and the formulations of computationally hard problems in terms of quantum mechanical systems. In order to characterize the microscopic description of such dynamics in the language of inferential statistics, covariance matrix estimation of d-dimensional Gaussian densities and Bayesian interpretation of eigenvalue problem for dynamical systems is assessed.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.20567v1,On computing the zeros of a class of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials,Nicola Mastronardi; Marc Van Barel; Raf Vandebril; Paul Van Dooren,"A fast and weakly stable method for computing the zeros of a particular class of hypergeometric polynomials is presented. The studied hypergeometric polynomials satisfy a higher order differential equation and generalize Laguerre polynomials. The theoretical study of the asymptotic distribution of the spectrum of these polynomials is an active research topic. In this article we do not contribute to the theory, but provide a practical method to contribute to further and better understanding of the asymptotic behavior. The polynomials under consideration fit into the class of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, satisfying a four--term recurrence relation. This allows computing the roots via a generalized eigenvalue problem. After condition enhancing similarity transformations, the problem is transformed into the computation of the eigenvalues of a comrade matrix, which is a symmetric tridiagonal modified by a rank--one matrix. The eigenvalues are then retrieved by relying on an existing structured rank based fast algorithm. Numerical examples are reported studying the accuracy, stability and conforming the efficiency for various parameter settings of the proposed approach.",NA,NA,0,1

This is under the assumption that the measurement operators and prediction functions are sufficiently smooth and their corresponding stochastic moments with respect to the prior distribution exist. Numerical experiments are presented to the illustrate the theoretical results.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.20474v1,Consistent splitting SAV schemes for finite element approximations of incompressible flows,Douglas R. Q. Pacheco,"Consistent splitting schemes are among the most accurate pressure segregation methods, incurring no splitting errors or spurious boundary conditions. Nevertheless, their theoretical properties are not yet fully understood, especially when finite elements are used for the spatial discretisation. This work proposes a simple scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) technique that, when combined with standard finite elements in space, guarantees unconditional stability for first- and second-order consistent splitting schemes. The framework is implicit-explicit (IMEX) and only requires solving linear transport equations and a pressure Poisson problem per time step. Furthermore, pressure stability is attained with respect to a stronger norm than in classical projection schemes, which allows eliminating the inf-sup compatibility requirement on the velocity-pressure pairs. The accuracy of the new framework is assessed through numerical examples.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.20437v1,Which variables of a numerical problem cause ill-conditioning?,Nick Dewaele,"We study a broad class of numerical problems that can be defined as the solution of a system of (nonlinear) equations for a subset of the dependent variables. Given a system of the form $F(x,y,z) = c$ with multivariate input $x$ and dependent variables $y$ and $z$, we define and give concrete expressions for the condition number of solving for a value of $y$ such that $F(x,y,z) = c$ for some unspecified $z$. This condition number can be used to determine which of the dependent variables of a numerical problem are the most ill-conditioned. We show how this can be used to explain the condition number of the problem of solving for all dependent variables, even if the solution is not unique. The concepts are illustrated with Tucker decomposition of tensors as an example problem.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.20372v1,Second order divergence constraint preserving schemes for two-fluid relativistic plasma flow equations,Jaya Agnihotri; Deepak Bhoriya; Harish Kumar; Praveen Chandrashekar; Dinshaw S. Balsara,"Two-fluid relativistic plasma flow equations combine the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics with Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields, which involve divergence constraints for the magnetic and electric fields. When developing numerical schemes for the model, the divergence constraints are ignored, or Maxwell's equations are reformulated as Perfectly Hyperbolic Maxwell's (PHM) equations by introducing additional equations for correction potentials. In the latter case, the divergence constraints are preserved only as the limiting case.   In this article, we present second-order numerical schemes that preserve the divergence constraint for electric and magnetic fields at the discrete level. The schemes are based on using a multidimensional Riemann solver at the vertices of the cells to define the numerical fluxes on the edges. The second-order accuracy is obtained by reconstructing the electromagnetic fields at the corners using a MinMod limiter. The discretization of Maxwell's equations can be combined with any consistent and stable discretization of the fluid parts. In particular, we consider entropy-stable schemes for the fluid part. The resulting schemes are second-order accurate, entropy stable, and preserve the divergence constraints of the electromagnetic fields. We use explicit and IMEX-based time discretizations. We then test these schemes using several one- and two-dimensional test cases. We also compare the divergence constraint errors of the proposed schemes with schemes having no divergence constraints treatment and schemes based on the PHM-based divergence cleaning.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.20283v1,A Semi-Lagrangian scheme for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions,Elisabetta Carlini; Athena Picarelli; Francisco J. Silva,"We study the numerical approximation of time-dependent, possibly degenerate, second-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations in bounded domains with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. It is well known that convergence towards the exact solution of the equation, considered here in the viscosity sense, holds if the scheme is monotone, consistent, and stable. While standard finite difference schemes are, in general, not monotone, the so-called semi-Lagrangian schemes are monotone by construction. On the other hand, these schemes make use of a wide stencil and, when the equation is set in a bounded domain, this typically causes an overstepping of the boundary and hence the loss of consistency. We propose here a semi-Lagrangian scheme defined on an unstructured mesh, with a suitable treatment at grid points near the boundary to preserve consistency, and show its convergence for problems where the viscosity solution can even be discontinuous. We illustrate the numerical convergence in several tests, including degenerate and first-order equations.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.20096v1,The Geometric Refinement Transform: A Novel Uncountably Infinite Transform Space,Zachary Mullaghy,"This work introduces a novel and general class of continuous transforms based on hierarchical Voronoi based refinement schemes. The resulting transform space generalizes classical approaches such as wavelets and Radon transforms by incorporating parameters of refinement multiplicity, dispersion, and rotation. We rigorously establish key properties of the transform including completeness, uniqueness, invertibility, closure, and stability using frame bounds over functions of bounded variation and define a natural inner product structure emerging in L2. We identify regions of parameter space that recover known transforms, including multiscale wavelet decompositions and the generalized Radon transform. Applications are discussed across a range of disciplines, with particular emphasis on entropy formulations. Notably, the transform remains well behaved on geometrically complex and even non convex domains, where traditional methods may struggle. Despite the complexity of the underlying geometry, the coefficient spectrum reveals structure, offering insight even in highly irregular settings.",NA,NA,0,1

Winters; Jan Nordström,"We derive global estimates for the error in solutions of linear hyperbolic systems due to inaccurate boundary geometry. We show that the error is bounded by data and bounded in time when the solutions in the true and approximate domains are bounded. We show that boundary data evaluation errors due to the incorrect locations of the boundaries are secondary effects, whereas the primary errors are from the Jacobian and metric terms. In two space dimensions, specifically, we show that to lowest order the errors are proportional to the errors in the boundary curves and their derivatives. The results illustrate the importance of accurately approximating boundaries, and they should be helpful for high-order mesh generation and the design of optimization algorithms for boundary approximations.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.19784v1,Adaptive refinement in defeaturing problems via an equilibrated flux a posteriori error estimator,Annalisa Buffa; Denise Grappein; Rafael Vázquez,"An adaptive refinement strategy, based on an equilibrated flux a posteriori error estimator, is proposed in the context of defeaturing problems. Defeaturing consists in removing features from complex domains in order to ease the meshing process, and to reduce the computational burden of simulations. It is a common procedure, for example, in computer aided design for simulation based manufacturing. However, depending on the problem at hand, the effect of geometrical simplification on the accuracy of the solution may be detrimental. The proposed adaptive strategy is hence twofold: starting from a defeatured geometry it allows both for standard mesh refinement and geometrical refinement, which consists in choosing, at each step, which features need to be included into the geometry in order to significantly increase the accuracy of the solution. With respect to other estimators that were previously proposed in the context of defeaturing, the use of an equilibrated flux reconstruction allows us to avoid the evaluation of the numerical flux on the boundary of features. This makes the estimator and the adaptive strategy particularly well-suited for finite element discretizations, in which the numerical flux is typically discontinuous across element edges. The inclusion of the features during the adaptive process is tackled by a CutFEM strategy, in order to preserve the non conformity of the mesh to the feature boundary and never remesh the computational domain as the features are added. Hence, the estimator also accounts for the error introduced by weakly imposing the boundary conditions on the boundary of the added features.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.19701v1,Enhanced gradient recovery-based a posteriori error estimator and adaptive finite element method for elliptic equations,Ying Liu; Jingjing Xiao; Nianyu Yi; Huihui Cao,"Recovery type a posteriori error estimators are popular, particularly in the engineering community, for their computationally inexpensive, easy to implement, and generally asymptotically exactness. Unlike the residual type error estimators, one can not establish upper and lower a posteriori error bounds for the classical recovery type error estimators without the saturation assumption. In this paper, we first present three examples to show the unsatisfactory performance in the practice of standard residual or recovery-type error estimators, then, an improved gradient recovery-based a posteriori error estimator is constructed. The proposed error estimator contains two parts, one is the difference between the direct and post-processed gradient approximations, and the other is the residual of the recovered gradient. The reliability and efficiency of the enhanced estimator are derived. Based on the improved recovery-based error estimator and the newest-vertex bisection refinement method with a tailored mark strategy, an adaptive finite element algorithm is designed. We then prove the convergence of the adaptive method by establishing the contraction of gradient error plus oscillation. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the asymptotic exactness of the new recovery-based a posteriori error estimator and the high efficiency of the corresponding adaptive algorithm.",NA,NA,0,1

CBCs are based on the characteristic decomposition of the compressible Euler equations and are designed to prevent the reflection of waves at the domain boundaries. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method for weakly compressible flows through a series of numerical experiments by comparing the results with common boundary conditions in the HDG setting and reference solutions available in the literature. In particular, HDG with CBCs show superior performance minimizing the reflection of vortices at artificial boundaries, for both inviscid and viscous flows.",NA,NA,0,1

We first formulate the diffusive relaxation system based on the even-odd decomposition method, which allows us to split into one relaxation step and one transport step. We adopt a robust implicit scheme that can be explicitly implemented for the relaxation step that involves the stiffness of the collision term, while the third-order strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method is employed for the transport step. We couple this temporal scheme with the DG method for spatial discretization, which provides additional advantages including high-order accuracy, $h$-$p$ adaptivity, and the ability to handle arbitrary unstructured meshes. A positivity-preserving limiter is further applied to preserve physical properties of numerical solutions. The stability analysis using the even-odd decomposition is conducted for the first time.

2503.19483v1,Empirical Hyper Element Integration Method (EHEIM) with Unified Integration Criteria for Efficient Hyper Reduced FE$^2$ Simulations,Nils Lange; Geralf Hütter; Bjoern Kiefer,"Numerical homogenization for mechanical multiscale modeling by means of the finite element method (FEM) is an elegant way of obtaining structure-property relations, if the behavior of the constituents of the lower scale is well understood. However, the computational costs of this so-called FE$^2$ method are so high that reduction methods are essential. While the construction of a reduced basis for the microscopic nodal displacements using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has become a standard technique, the reduction of the computational effort for the projected nodal forces, the so-called hyper reduction, is an additional challenge, for which different strategies have been proposed in the literature. The empirical cubature method (ECM), which has been proven to be very robust, implemented the conservation of the total volume is used as a constraint in the resulting optimization problem, while energy-based criteria have been proposed in other contributions.   The present contribution presents a unified integration criteria concept, involving the aforementioned criteria, among others. These criteria are used both with a Gauss point-based as well as with an element-based hyper reduction scheme, the latter retaining full compatibility with the common modular finite element framework. The methods are combined with a previously proposed clustered training strategy and a monolithic solver. Numerical examples empirically demonstrate that the additional criteria improve the accuracy for a given number of modes. Vice verse, less modes and thus lower computational costs are required to reach a given level of accuracy.",NA,NA,0,1

The quasi-periodic problem is first transformed into a periodic one on the cube by the Floquet-Bloch theory. Then the compensation operator is introduced in Maxwell's equation with the shifted curl operator. The discrete problem depends on the compatible discretization of the de Rham complex, which is implemented by the mimetic finite difference method in this paper. We prove that the compensation term exactly fills up the kernel of the original problem and avoids spurious eigenvalues. Also, we propose an efficient preconditioner and its FFT and multigrid solvers, which allow parallel computing.

Approximating such solutions in the stochastic setting is particularly challenging due to randomized frequency interactions and presents a compelling challenge for the construction of tailored schemes. In particular, we design the first resonance-based schemes for this equation, which achieve provable convergence for solutions of much lower regularity than previously required. A crucial ingredient in this construction is the Wong--Zakai approximation of stochastic dispersive system, which introduces piecewise linear phases that capture nonlinear frequency interactions and can subsequently be approximated to construct resonance-based schemes. We prove the well-posedness of the Wong--Zakai approximated equation and establish its proximity to the original full stochastic dispersive system. Based on this approximation, we demonstrate an improved strong convergence rate for our new scheme, which exploits the stochastic nature of the dispersive terms. Finally, we provide numerical experiments underlining the favourable performance of our novel method in practice.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.19333v1,E-PINNs: Epistemic Physics-Informed Neural Networks,Ashish S. Nair; Bruno Jacob; Amanda A. Howard; Jan Drgona; Panos Stinis,"Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated promise as a framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations. Despite recent progress in the field, it remains challenging to quantify uncertainty in these networks. While approaches such as Bayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) provide a principled approach to capturing uncertainty through Bayesian inference, they can be computationally expensive for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose Epistemic Physics-Informed Neural Networks (E-PINNs), a framework that leverages a small network, the \emph{epinet}, to efficiently quantify uncertainty in PINNs. The proposed approach works as an add-on to existing, pre-trained PINNs with a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in various test cases and compare the results with B-PINNs using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) posterior estimation and dropout-equipped PINNs (Dropout-PINNs). Our experiments show that E-PINNs provide similar coverage to B-PINNs, with often comparable sharpness, while being computationally more efficient. This observation, combined with E-PINNs' more consistent uncertainty estimates and better calibration compared to Dropout-PINNs for the examples presented, indicates that E-PINNs offer a promising approach in terms of accuracy-efficiency trade-off.",NA,NA,0,1

Furthermore, we analyze the convergence behavior of the Minimal Residual method in the presence of small outlier eigenvalues linked to specific boundary conditions, which can lead to slow convergence or stagnation. To address this issue, we employ deflation techniques to accelerate the convergence. Finally, Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.",NA,NA,0,1

Kevrekidis,"Classically, to solve differential equation problems, it is necessary to specify sufficient initial and/or boundary conditions so as to allow the existence of a unique solution. Well-posedness of differential equation problems thus involves studying the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and their dependence to such pre-specified conditions. However, in part due to mathematical necessity, these conditions are usually specified ""to arbitrary precision"" only on (appropriate portions of) the boundary of the space-time domain. This does not mirror how data acquisition is performed in realistic situations, where one may observe entire ""patches"" of solution data at arbitrary space-time locations; alternatively one might have access to more than one solutions stemming from the same differential operator. In our short work, we demonstrate how standard tools from machine and manifold learning can be used to infer, in a data driven manner, certain well-posedness features of differential equation problems, for initial/boundary condition combinations under which rigorous existence/uniqueness theorems are not known. Our study naturally combines a data assimilation perspective with an operator-learning one.",NA,NA,0,1

This one-parameter benchmark equation is derived from a general one-dimensional first-order SDE using spatio-temporal nondimensionalization and is employed to evaluate the performance of (1) Euler-Maruyama (EM), (2) Milstein (Mil), (3) Stochastic Heun (SH), and (4) a three-stage Runge-Kutta scheme (RK3).   Our findings reveal that lower-order schemes can outperform higher-order ones over a range of time step sizes, depending on the benchmark parameters and application context. The theoretical results are validated through a series of numerical experiments, and we discuss their implications for more general applications, including a nonlinear example of particle transport in porous media under various conditions.

In particular, we train the network via Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) on the residual of the equation collocated on -- eventually randomly chosen -- points. Because the approximation is done directly in the formulation, such a method falls into the framework of Physically Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and has been named PIELM. Since its first introduction, the method has been refined variously, and one successful variant is the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (XTFC). However, XTFC strongly takes advantage of the description of the domain as a tensor product. Our aim is to extend XTFC to domains with general shapes. The novelty of the procedure proposed in the present paper is related to the treatment of boundary conditions via constrained imposition, so that our method is named Least Squares with Equality constraints ELM (LSEELM).

We propose a Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (TR-SSQP) method and establish its high-probability iteration complexity bounds for identifying first- and second-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. In our algorithm, we assume that exact objective values, gradients, and Hessians are not directly accessible but can be estimated via zeroth-, first-, and second-order probabilistic oracles. Compared to existing complexity studies of SSQP methods that rely on a zeroth-order oracle with sub-exponential tail noise (i.e., light-tailed) and focus mostly on first-order stationarity, our analysis accommodates irreducible and heavy-tailed noise in the zeroth-order oracle and significantly extends the analysis to second-order stationarity. We show that under weaker noise conditions, our method achieves the same high-probability first-order iteration complexity bounds, while also exhibiting promising second-order iteration complexity bounds. Specifically, the method identifies a first-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and a second-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations with high probability, provided that $\epsilon$ is lower bounded by a constant determined by the irreducible noise level in estimation.

Under this condition, we show that sketched GMRES is backward stable as long as the condition number of $B_{1:i}$ is not too large. Under additional assumptions, we then show that the stability of a restarted implementation of sketched GMRES can be independent of the condition number of $B_{1:i}$, and restarted sketched GMRES is backward stable. We also derive sharper bounds that explain why the backward error can be small even in cases when the basis $B_{1:i}$ is very ill-conditioned, which has been observed in the literature but not yet explained theoretically.

Noticeably absent from the literature is a systematic exploration of the stability of the solutions generated by these ML approaches. Here, a recurrent network is introduced that matches precisely the evaluation of a multistep method paired with a collocation method for approximating spatial derivatives in the advection diffusion equation. This allows for two things: 1) the use of traditional tools for analyzing the stability of a numerical method for solving PDEs and 2) bringing to bear efficient techniques of ML for the training of approximations for the action of (spatial) linear operators. Observations on impacts of varying the large number of parameters in even this simple linear problem are presented.

2503.18759v1,Efficient QR-Based CP Decomposition Acceleration via Dimension Tree and Extrapolation,Wenchao Xie; Jiawei Xu; Zheng Peng; Qingsong Wang,"The canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition is one of the most widely used tensor decomposition techniques. The conventional CP decomposition algorithm combines alternating least squares (ALS) with the normal equation. However, the normal equation is susceptible to numerical ill-conditioning, which can adversely affect the decomposition results. To mitigate this issue, ALS combined with QR decomposition has been proposed as a more numerically stable alternative. Although this method enhances stability, its iterative process involves tensor-times-matrix (TTM) operations, which typically result in higher computational costs. To reduce this cost, we propose branch reutilization of dimension tree, which increases the reuse of intermediate tensors and reduces the number of TTM operations. This strategy achieves a $33\%$ reduction in computational complexity for third and fourth order tensors. Additionally, we introduce a specialized extrapolation method in CP-ALS-QR algorithm, leveraging the unique structure of the matrix $\mathbf{Q}_0$ to further enhance convergence. By integrating both techniques, we develop a novel CP decomposition algorithm that significantly improves efficiency. Numerical experiments on five real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithm reduces iteration costs and enhances fitting accuracy compared to the CP-ALS-QR algorithm.",NA,NA,0,1

In this paper, we investigate the best accuracy when using the adaptive refinement. To this end, we study the evolution of the truncation error and the round-off error using the adaptive refinement. For the former, a new threshold for the selection of the number of elements to be refined is proposed. For the latter, the round-off error is quantified using the method proposed in \cite{liu2022practical}.

2503.18659v1,A filtered two-step variational integrator for charged-particle dynamics in a normal or strong magnetic field,Ting Li; Bin Wang,"This article is concerned with a new filtered two-step variational integrator for solving the charged-particle dynamics in a mildly non-homogeneous normal or strong magnetic field with a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$ inversely proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. In the case of a normal magnetic field ($\epsilon \approx 1$), second-order error bounds and long time energy and momentum conservations are obtained. Moreover, the proof of the long-term analysis is accomplished by the backward error analysis. For the strong magnetic field ($0<\epsilon \ll1$), this paper clarifies the behaviour of the filtered variational integrator for both a large stepsize $h^2 \geq \epsilon$ and a smaller stepsize $ h \sim \epsilon$. The approach to analysing the error bounds for these two stepsizes is based on comparing the modulated Fourier expansions of the exact and the numerical solutions. It is shown that the proposed integrator achieves a second-order accuracy $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ in the position and in the parallel velocity for a large step size and an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ accuracy for a smaller stepsize. This paper also yields the long time energy and magnetic moment conservations for the strong magnetic field by developing the modulated Fourier expansion of the proposed scheme. All the theoretical results of the error behaviour and long-term conservations are numerically demonstrated by two numerical experiments.",NA,NA,0,1

We show that the M-Shardlow method in which for its construction, the second order velocity Verlet method in the Shardlows method to integrate the Hamiltonian part has been replaced by a symplectic fourth order method, improperly uses some parameters. %In other words, in this paper, it is shown that the initial M-Shardlow method employed some parameters improperly in the fourth order symplectic method that was used for the M-Shardlow method. By numerical experiments and computing, some important configurational quantities such as configurational temperature and radial distribution function (RDF), the M-Shardlow's method is compared with the Shardlow and ABOBA methods. These results indicate that the new method obtained in this way, even with the proper parameters is too costly in the sense of the CPU-time that is required per each step which makes it an inefficient DPD integrator. Besides, by a comparison of the radial distribution function of this method with Shardlow and ABOBA for large time increments, we can observe no considerable improvement in preserving the structure of the system by this new DPD solver.",NA,NA,0,1

Strategies for controlling the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) are of great benefit for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) where shock interactions with many small imperfections in the density interface lead to instabilities which rapidly grow over time. These instabilities lead to mixing which, in the case of laser driven ICF, quenches the runaway fusion process ruining the potential for positive energy return. We demonstrate that control of these instabilities can be achieved by optimization of initial conditions with (> 100) parameters. Optimizing over a large parameter space like this is not possible with gradient-free optimization strategies. This requires computation of the gradient of the outputs of a numerical solution to the equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics with respect to the inputs. We show that the efficient computation of these gradients is made possible via a judicious application of (i) adjoint methods, the exact formal representation of sensitivities involving partial differential equations, and (ii) automatic differentiation (AD), the algorithmic calculation of derivatives of functions. Careful regularization of multiple operators including artificial viscosity and timestep control is required.

2503.17463v1,Model reduction of convection-dominated viscous conservation laws using implicit feature tracking and landmark image registration,Victor Zucatti; Matthew J. Zahr,"Reduced-order models (ROMs) remain generally unreliable for convection-dominated problems, such as those encountered in hypersonic flows, due to the slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width of linear subspace approximations, known as the Kolmogorov barrier. This limitation hinders the accuracy of traditional ROMs and necessitates impractical amounts of training data during the offline phase. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel landmark-based registration procedure tailored for ROMs of convection-dominated problems. Our approach leverages limited training data and incorporates a nonlinear transformation of the data using a landmark-based registration technique combined with radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. During the offline phase, we align dominant convective features in a reference domain, resulting in a rapid decay of error relative to the reduced space dimension. Landmarks are generated through a three-step process: (1) detecting shocks via edge detection techniques, (2) sampling using Monte Carlo methods, and (3) domain partitioning with $k$-means clustering, where cluster centroids serve as landmarks. Accurate landmark correspondence is achieved by minimizing pairing distances for similar features. The online phase integrates standard minimum-residual ROM methodologies, extending the optimization space to include admissible domain mappings. We validate our approach on two test cases: a space-time Burgers' equation parameterized by the initial condition, and a hypersonic viscous flow over a cylinder parameterized by the Mach number. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in overcoming the Kolmogorov barrier and enhancing the reliability of ROMs for convection-dominated problems.",NA,NA,0,1

Rayleigh-Ritz provides optimal eigenvalue approximations within subspaces; we find that spurious-state filtering allows these optimality guarantees to be retained in the presence of statistical noise. We explore the relation between Lanczos and Prony's method, their block generalizations, generalized pencil of functions (GPOF), and methods based on the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), and find they all fall into a larger ""Prony-Ritz equivalence class"", identified as all methods which solve a finite-dimensional spectrum exactly given sufficient correlation function (matrix) data.

The centroidal Voronoi Delaunay triangulation mesh optimization is embedded in the mesh adaption to provide high-quality mesh, and then assure that the superconvergence property of the recovered gradient and the asymptotical exactness of the error estimator.

We employ the ARMS technique to give an explicit and accurate representation of moving boundaries, and introduce a cell-merging technique to overcome discontinuities caused by topological changes in cut cells and the small cell problem. We use a polynomial interpolation technique base on poised lattice generation to achieve fourth-order spatial discretization, and use a fourth-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for time integration. Numerical tests are performed on various moving regions, with advection velocity both matching and differing from boundary velocity, which demonstrate the fourth-order accuracy of the proposed method.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2503.16792v1,Numerical simulation of wormhole propagation with the mixed hybridized discontinuous Galerkin finite element method,Jiansong Zhang; Jiang Zhu; Yiming Wang; Yanyu Liu; Hui Guo,"The acid treatment of carbonate reservoirs is a widely employed technique for enhancing the productivity of oil and gas reservoirs. In this paper, we present a novel combined hybridized mixed discontinuous Galerkin (HMDG) finite element method to simulate the dissolution process near the wellbore, commonly referred to as the wormhole phenomenon. The primary contribution of this work lies in the application of hybridization techniques to both the pressure and concentration equations. Additionally, an upwind scheme is utilized to address convection-dominant scenarios, and a ``cut-off"" operator is introduced to maintain the boundedness of porosity. Compared to traditional discontinuous Galerkin methods, the proposed approach results in a global system with fewer unknowns and sparser stencils, thereby significantly reducing computational costs.

A key feature of this model is that reactions between different species occur only at the interface, and may induce deformation of the interface. For the governing equations derived based on the energy variational method, we propose a structure-preserving numerical scheme that satisfies the mass conservation and energy dissipation laws at the discrete level. Furthermore, we carry out a rigorous error analysis of the time-discrete scheme for a simplified case. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the model as well as the accuracy and stability of the scheme.

The resulting block orthogonalization schemes generate the basis vectors whose overall orthogonality error is bounded by machine precision as long as each of the corresponding block vectors are numerically full rank. We implement these randomized block orthogonalization schemes using standard distributed-memory linear algebra kernels for s-step GMRES available in the Trilinos software packages.

Altschuler; Jelena Diakonikolas,"In 1960, Osborne proposed a simple iterative algorithm for matrix balancing with outstanding numerical performance. Today, it is the default preconditioning procedure before eigenvalue computation and other linear algebra subroutines in mainstream software packages such as Python, Julia, MATLAB, EISPACK, LAPACK, and more. Despite its widespread usage, Osborne's algorithm has long resisted theoretical guarantees for its runtime: the first polynomial-time guarantees were obtained only in the past decade, and recent near-linear runtimes remain confined to variants of Osborne's algorithm with important differences that make them simpler to analyze but empirically slower. In this paper, we address this longstanding gap between theory and practice by proving that Osborne's original algorithm -- the de facto preconditioner in practice -- in fact has a near-linear runtime. This runtime guarantee (1) is optimal in the input size up to at most a single logarithm, (2) is the first runtime for Osborne's algorithm that does not dominate the runtime of downstream tasks like eigenvalue computation, and (3) improves upon the theoretical runtimes for all other variants of Osborne's algorithm.",NA,NA,0,1

Zygalakis,"This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play (PnP) Langevin sampling methodology for Bayesian inference in low-photon Poisson imaging problems, a challenging class of problems with significant applications in astronomy, medicine, and biology. PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.16210v1,On the convergence of split exponential integrators for semilinear parabolic problems,Marco Caliari; Fabio Cassini; Lukas Einkemmer; Alexander Ostermann,"Splitting the exponential-like $\varphi$ functions, which typically appear in exponential integrators, is attractive in many situations since it can dramatically reduce the computational cost of the procedure. However, depending on the employed splitting, this can result in order reduction. The aim of this paper is to analyze different such split approximations. We perform the analysis for semilinear problems in the abstract framework of commuting semigroups and derive error bounds that depend, in particular, on whether the vector (to which the $\varphi$ functions are applied) satisfies appropriate boundary conditions. We then present the convergence analysis for two split versions of a second-order exponential Runge--Kutta integrator in the context of analytic semigroups, and show that one suffers from order reduction while the other does not. Numerical results for semidiscretized parabolic PDEs confirm the theoretical findings.",NA,NA,0,1

In the first part of the paper we prove that square root Lasso $({\tt rLasso})$ with a particular choice of the regularization parameter $\lambda>0$ as well as orthogonal matching pursuit $({\tt OMP})$ after sufficiently many iterations provide noise blind decoders which efficiently recover multivariate functions from random samples. In contrast to basis pursuit the decoders $({\tt rLasso})$ and $({\tt OMP})$ do not require any additional information on the width of the function class in $L_\infty$ and lead to instance optimal recovery guarantees. In the second part of the paper we relate the findings to linear recovery methods such as least squares $({\tt Lsqr})$ or Smolyak's algorithm $({\tt Smolyak})$ and compare the performance in a model situation, namely periodic multivariate functions with $L_p$-bounded mixed derivative will be approximated in $L_q$. The main observation is the fact, that $({\tt rLasso})$ and $({\tt OMP})$ outperform Smolyak's algorithm (sparse grids) in various situations, where $1<p<2\leq q<\infty$.

This paper develops a stochastic geometry-based analytical model for GASS under Matern hard-core point process (MHCPP) distributed AVs. The 3D distributions of AVs and GUs are modeled by considering their locations on spherical surfaces in the presence of high-altitude satellites.

Due to the different natures of the elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. In the new DG method, the averages, jumps and penalties are minimal, correctly and only imposed on the diffusion-diffusion element boundaries, in addition to the well-known upwind jumps associating with the advection velocity. For the advection-dominated problem, the penalties can be further reduced only being imposed on the diffusion-dominated subset of the diffusion-diffusion element boundaries.This is based on the novel, crucial technique about the multiple partitions of the set of the interelement boundaries into a number of subsets with respect to the diffusion and to the advection and on the consistency result we have proven. The new DG method is the first DG method and the first time that the continuity and discontinuity of the solution are correctly identified and justified of the general steady-state linear partial differential equations of nonnegative characteristic form. The new DG method and its analysis are applied to the miscible displacement problem of vanishing diffusion coefficient and of low regularity, dominating Darcy flow velocity which lives in $H(\operatorname{div};\Omega)\cap \prod_{j=1}^J (H^r(D_j))^d$ for $r<1$ other than the usual assumption $(W^{1,\infty}(\Omega))^d$. We prove the SUPG-type error estimates $\mathcal{O}(h^{\ell+\frac{1}{2}})$ for any element polynomial of degree $\ell\ge 1$ on generally shaped and nonconforming meshes, where the convergence order is independent of the regularity of the advection velocity. The SUPG-type error estimates obtained are new and the first time known under the low regularity of the advection velocity.",NA,NA,0,1

For irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensors, all the M$^+$-eigenvalues are M$^{++}$-eigenvalues. Although the M$^+$-eigenvalues of irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensors are not unique in general, we establish a sufficient condition to ensure their uniqueness. For an irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensor, the largest M$^+$-eigenvalue has a max-min characterization, while the smallest M$^+$-eigenvalue has a min-max characterization.

We describe and compare second order accurate numerical schemes, focusing on implicit methods, to effectively model transport phenomena without stability restriction on the choice of time steps. Furthermore, a high resolution form of the method is proposed that limits a priori the second order accurate scheme towards first order accuracy to keep the values of numerical solutions in a physically acceptable range.   Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of high resolution methods in minimizing oscillations near discontinuities, thereby enhancing solution plausibility. The observed convergence rates confirm that the second order accurate schemes achieve expected accuracy for smooth solutions and that they yield significant improvements when compared with the results of the first order scheme. As the computational cost of the compact implicit method seems to be comparable to similar explicit ones with a clear profit of unconditional stability, this research provides a practical tool toward numerical simulations of nonlinear transport phenomena applicable in various fields such as contaminant transport in porous media or column liquid chromatography.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2503.16028v2,Sequential Monte Carlo with Gaussian Mixture Approximation for Infinite-Dimensional Statistical Inverse Problems,Haoyu Lu; Junxiong Jia; Deyu Meng,"By formulating the inverse problem of partial differential equations (PDEs) as a statistical inference problem, the Bayesian approach provides a general framework for quantifying uncertainties. In the inverse problem of PDEs, parameters are defined on an infinite-dimensional function space, and the PDEs induce a computationally intensive likelihood function. Additionally, sparse data tends to lead to a multi-modal posterior. These features make it difficult to apply existing sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we propose new conditions for the likelihood functions, construct a Gaussian mixture based preconditioned Crank-Nicolson transition kernel, and demonstrate the universal approximation property of the infinite-dimensional Gaussian mixture probability measure. By combining these three novel tools, we propose a new SMC algorithm, named SMC-GM. For this new algorithm, we obtain a convergence theorem that allows Gaussian priors, illustrating that the sequential particle filter actually reproduces the true posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed new algorithm is rigorously defined on the infinite-dimensional function space, naturally exhibiting the discretization-invariant property. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new approach has a strong ability to probe the multi-modality of the posterior, significantly reduces the computational burden, and numerically exhibits the discretization-invariant property (important for large-scale problems).",NA,NA,0,1

In this regime, the solution of the NLDE exhibits highly oscillatory behavior in time, characterized by a wavelength of O($\varepsilon^{2}$) with a small parameter $\varepsilon>0$. To ensure uniform temporal accuracy, we employ a two-scale approach in conjunction with exponential integrators, utilizing operator decomposition techniques for the NLDE. The proposed methods are rigorously proved to achieve fourth-order uniform accuracy in time for all $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$. Furthermore, we successfully incorporate symmetry into the integrator, and the long-term near conservation properties are analyzed through the modulated Fourier expansion.

This study developed a variable projection augmented Lagrangian (VPAL) method for 5D motion-resolved image reconstruction and compared it with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in five numerical simulations and 15 in-vivo pediatric data set.   Approach: Relative error of the reconstructed images against the ground-truth images was assessed in numerical simulations. In-vivo analysis compared reconstruction time, mid-short axis (SA) blood-myocardium sharpness, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and a radiologist's image quality ratings between VPAL and ADMM. A paired t-test (p<0.05) was used to determine statistical significance, while linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis for agreement assessments.   Results: VPAL and ADMM had similar relative errors compared to the ground truth, p = 0.07. In in-vivo datasets, VPAL reduced the reconstruction time from 16.3 +/- 3.6 hours (ADMM) to 4.7 +/- 1.1 hours (VPAL), p=1e-10. Blood-myocardium border sharpness in VPAL closely correlates to ADMM , R^2 = 0.97.

For this setting, we prove approximation bounds that tell us the accuracy to which we can approximate a continuous function with a shallow neural network with such constraints.

2503.15077v1,Efficient forward and inverse uncertainty quantification for dynamical systems based on dimension reduction and Kriging surrogate modeling in functional space,Zhouzhou Song; Weiyun Xu; Marcos A. Valdebenito; Matthias G. R. Faes,"Surrogate models are extensively employed for forward and inverse uncertainty quantification in complex, computation-intensive engineering problems. Nonetheless, constructing high-accuracy surrogate models for complex dynamical systems with limited training samples continues to be a challenge, as capturing the variability in high-dimensional dynamical system responses with a small training set is inherently difficult. This study introduces an efficient Kriging modeling framework based on functional dimension reduction (KFDR) for conducting forward and inverse uncertainty quantification in dynamical systems. By treating the responses of dynamical systems as functions of time, the proposed KFDR method first projects these responses onto a functional space spanned by a set of predefined basis functions, which can deal with noisy data by adding a roughness regularization term. A few key latent functions are then identified by solving the functional eigenequation, mapping the time-variant responses into a low-dimensional latent functional space. Subsequently, Kriging surrogate models with noise terms are constructed in the latent space. With an inverse mapping established from the latent space to the original output space, the proposed approach enables accurate and efficient predictions for dynamical systems. Finally, the surrogate model derived from KFDR is directly utilized for efficient forward and inverse uncertainty quantification of the dynamical system. Through three numerical examples, the proposed method demonstrates its ability to construct highly accurate surrogate models and perform uncertainty quantification for dynamical systems accurately and efficiently.",NA,NA,0,1

These condition numbers can vary widely from one component to the other, thus creating a significant opportunity to introduce mixed precision: each component should be accumulated in a precision inversely proportional to the product of these condition numbers. We propose a practical algorithm that exploits this observation: it first computes all components in low precision, uses this output to estimate the condition numbers, and recomputes in higher precision only the components associated with large condition numbers. We test our algorithm on various networks and datasets and confirm experimentally that it can significantly improve the cost--accuracy tradeoff compared with uniform precision accumulation baselines.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.14978v1,Inferring diffusivity from killed diffusion,Richard Nickl; Fanny Seizilles,"We consider diffusion of independent molecules in an insulated Euclidean domain with unknown diffusivity parameter. At a random time and position, the molecules may bind and stop diffusing in dependence of a given `binding potential'. The binding process can be modeled by an additive random functional corresponding to the canonical construction of a `killed' diffusion Markov process. We study the problem of conducting inference on the infinite-dimensional diffusion parameter from a histogram plot of the `killing' positions of the process. We show first that these positions follow a Poisson point process whose intensity measure is determined by the solution of a certain Schr\""odinger equation. The inference problem can then be re-cast as a non-linear inverse problem for this PDE, which we show to be consistently solvable in a Bayesian way under natural conditions on the initial state of the diffusion, provided the binding potential is not too `aggressive'. In the course of our proofs we obtain novel posterior contraction rate results for high-dimensional Poisson count data that are of independent interest. A numerical illustration of the algorithm by standard MCMC methods is also provided.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

We design a numerical method based on the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm for the Wasserstain distance and the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) for the total variation, and the convergence analysis of the proposed numerical method is established.

2503.14913v1,A PINN-enriched finite element method for linear elliptic problems,Xiao Chen; Yixin Luo; Jingrun Chen,"In this paper, we propose a hybrid method that combines finite element method (FEM) and physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving linear elliptic problems. This method contains three steps: (1) train a PINN and obtain an approximate solution $u_{\theta}$; (2) enrich the finite element space with $u_{\theta}$; (3) obtain the final solution by FEM in the enriched space. In the second step, the enriched space is constructed by addition $v + u_{\theta}$ or multiplication $v \cdot u_{\theta}$, where $v$ belongs to the standard finite element space. We conduct the convergence analysis for the proposed method. Compared to the standard FEM, the same convergence order is obtained and higher accuracy can be achieved when solution derivatives are well approximated in PINN. Numerical examples from one dimension to three dimensions verify these theoretical results. For some examples, the accuracy of the proposed method can be reduced by a couple of orders of magnitude compared to the standard FEM.",NA,NA,0,1

The main objective is to recover the absorption coefficient from a single boundary measurement. While conventional gradient-based methods rely on the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of a cost functional with respect to the unknown parameter, we also utilize its shape derivative with respect to the unknown boundary interface for recovery. This non-conventional approach addresses the problem of parameter recovery from a single measurement, which represents the key innovation of this work.

2503.14750v1,Matrix nearness problems and eigenvalue optimization,Nicola Guglielmi; Christian Lubich,"This book is about solving matrix nearness problems that are related to eigenvalues or singular values or pseudospectra. These problems arise in great diversity in various fields, be they related to dynamics, as in questions of robust stability and robust control, or related to graphs, as in questions of clustering and ranking. Algorithms for such problems work with matrix perturbations that drive eigenvalues or singular values or Rayleigh quotients to desired locations.   Remarkably, the optimal perturbation matrices are typically of rank one or are projections of rank-1 matrices onto a linear structure, e.g. a prescribed sparsity pattern. In the approach worked out here, these optimal rank-1 perturbations will be determined in a two-level iteration: In the inner iteration, an eigenvalue optimization problem for a fixed perturbation size is to be solved via gradient-based rank-1 matrix differential equations. This amounts to numerically driving a rank-1 matrix, which is represented by two vectors, into a stationary point, mostly starting nearby. The outer iteration determines the optimal perturbation size by solving a scalar nonlinear equation.   A wide variety of matrix nearness problems, as outlined in the introductory Chapter I, will be tackled in Chapters II to VIII by such an approach and its nontrivial extensions.",NA,NA,0,1

While accurate validation of far-field performance can be performed in dedicated facilities like anechoic chambers, high cost of construction and maintenance might not justify their use for teaching, or low-budget research scenarios. Non-anechoic experiments provide a cost-effective alternative, however the performance metrics obtained in such conditions require appropriate correction. In this paper, we consider a multitaper approach for post-processing antenna far-field characteristics measured in challenging, non-anechoic environments. The discussed algorithm enhances one-shot measurements to enable extraction of line-of-sight responses while attenuating interferences from multi-path propagation and the noise from external sources of electromagnetic radiation. The performance of the considered method has been demonstrated in uncontrolled conditions using a compact spline-based monopole. Furthermore, the approach has been favorably validated against the state-of-the-art techniques from the literature.",NA,NA,0,1

However, the theoretical analysis and practical effectiveness of this method heavily rely on a good row paving of the coefficient matrix. This motivates us to introduce a novel block selection strategy to the RBK method, called volume sampling, in which the probability of selection is proportional to the volume spanned by the rows of the selected submatrix. To further enhance the practical performance, we develop and analyze a momentum variant of the method. Convergence results are established and demonstrate the notable improvements in convergence factor of the RBK method brought by the volume sampling and the momentum acceleration. Furthermore, to efficiently implement the RBK method with volume sampling, we propose an efficient algorithm that enables volume sampling from a sparse matrix with sampling complexity that is only logarithmic in dimension.

Ryan,"This article establishes the usefulness of the Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy-Increasing (SIAC) filter for reducing the errors in the mean and variance for a wave equation with uncertain coefficients solved via generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) whose coefficients are approximated using discontinuous Galerkin (DG-gPC). Theoretical error estimates that utilize information in the negative-order norm are established. While the gPC approximation leads to order of accuracy of $m-1/2$ for a sufficiently smooth solution (smoothness of $m$ in random space), the approximated coefficients solved via DG improves from order $k+1$ to $2k+1$ for a solution of smoothness $2k+2$ in physical space. Our numerical examples verify the performance of the filter for improving the quality of the approximation and reducing the numerical error and significantly eliminating the noise from the spatial approximation of the mean and variance. Further, we illustrate how the errors are effected by both the choice of smoothness of the kernel and number of function translates in the kernel. Hence, this article opens the applicability of SIAC filters to other hyperbolic problems with uncertainty, and other stochastic equations.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.13877v1,Shock with Confidence: Formal Proofs of Correctness for Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equation Solvers,Jonathan Gorard; Ammar Hakim,"First-order systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) occur ubiquitously throughout computational physics, commonly used in simulations of fluid turbulence, shock waves, electromagnetic interactions, and even general relativistic phenomena. Such equations are often challenging to solve numerically in the non-linear case, due to their tendency to form discontinuities even for smooth initial data, which can cause numerical algorithms to become unstable, violate conservation laws, or converge to physically incorrect solutions. In this paper, we introduce a new formal verification pipeline for such algorithms in Racket, which allows a user to construct a bespoke hyperbolic PDE solver for a specified equation system, generate low-level C code which verifiably implements that solver, and then produce formal proofs of various mathematical and physical correctness properties of the resulting implementation, including L^2 stability, flux conservation, and physical validity. We outline how these correctness proofs are generated, using a custom-built theorem-proving and automatic differentiation framework that fully respects the algebraic structure of floating-point arithmetic, and show how the resulting C code may either be used to run standalone simulations, or integrated into a larger computational multiphysics framework such as Gkeyll.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.13830v1,Hierarchical Gaussian Random Fields for Multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Coupling Stochastic Partial Differential Equation and The Karhunen-Loève Decomposition,Sohail Reddy,"This work introduces structure preserving hierarchical decompositions for sampling Gaussian random fields (GRF) within the context of multilevel Bayesian inference in high-dimensional space. Existing scalable hierarchical sampling methods, such as those based on stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), often reduce the dimensionality of the sample space at the cost of accuracy of inference. Other approaches, such that those based on Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansions, offer sample space dimensionality reduction but sacrifice GRF representation accuracy and ergodicity of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, and are computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems. The proposed method integrates the dimensionality reduction capabilities of KL expansions with the scalability of stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE)-based sampling, thereby providing a robust, unified framework for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification (UQ) that is scalable, accurate, preserves ergodicity, and offers dimensionality reduction of the sample space. The hierarchy in our multilevel algorithm is derived from the geometric multigrid hierarchy. By constructing a hierarchical decomposition that maintains the covariance structure across the levels in the hierarchy, the approach enables efficient coarse-to-fine sampling while ensuring that all samples are drawn from the desired distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a benchmark subsurface flow problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. Our proposed technique is more efficient, accurate, and displays better convergence properties than existing methods for high-dimensional Bayesian inference problems.",NA,NA,0,1

Mason; Patrick W. Goodwill,"This article presents a new robust model for image reconstruction in magnetic particle imaging (MPI) for single-axis drive field scans, which is based on the deconvolution of gridded harmonic data. Gridded harmonic data, used commonly in MPI, does not map to underlying iron density but rather to the iron density convolved with the harmonic point-spread functions. We refer to the gridded harmonic data as harmonic portraits, since they only represent a portrait-like representation of the iron density, and a deconvolution method is implemented to reconstruct the true underlying density. The advantage of this new method is primarily in the intermediate data analysis that comes in the harmonic portrait domain, where we are able to perform artifact correction, parameter selection, and general data assessment and calibrations efficiently. Furthermore, we show with several examples that our new method closely compares qualitatively with current state-of-the-art image reconstruction models in MPI. While the general concept of gridding harmonic data in MPI is not new, the complete modeling and characterization in order to use the data for image reconstruction has remained an ongoing area of research. We provide detailed analysis, theoretical insights, and many nuanced techniques that make our new methodology and algorithm accurate and robust.",NA,NA,0,1

Using a rational Gauss quadrature rule, the inner product can be discretized, thus allowing a linear algebraic approach. The presented approach involves reformulating the problem as an inverse eigenvalue problem involving a Hessenberg pencil, where the pencil will contain the recursion coefficients that generate the sequence of Sobolev orthogonal rational functions. This reformulation is based on the connection between Sobolev orthonormal rational functions and the orthonormal bases for rational Krylov subspaces generated by a Jordan-like matrix. An updating procedure, introducing the nodes of the inner product one after the other, is proposed and the performance is examined through some numerical examples.",NA,NA,0,1

We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach.

As it is well known, SL schemes are not well suited for unstructured grids, due to the cost of the point location phase; this drawback is augmented by the need for repeated minimization. In this work, we propose a scheme that works only on the basis of node values and connectivity of the grid. In a first version, we obtain a monotone scheme; then, applying a quadratic refinement to the numerical solution, we improve accuracy at the price of some extra computational cost. The scheme can be applied to both time-dependent and stationary HJ equations; in the latter case, we also study the construction of a fast policy iteration solver. We perform a theoretical analysis of the two versions, and validate them with an extensive set of examples, both in the time-dependent and in the stationary case.",NA,NA,0,1

2503.13284v1,Bayesian identification of material parameters in viscoelastic structures as an inverse problem in a semigroup setting,Rebecca Rothermel; Thomas Schuster,"The article considers the nonlinear inverse problem of identifying the material parameters in viscoelastic structures based on a generalized Maxwell model. The aim is to reconstruct the model parameters from stress data acquired from a relaxation experiment, where the number of Maxwell elements, and thus the number of material parameters themselves, are assumed to be unknown. This implies that the forward operator acts on a Cartesian product of a semigroup (of integers) and a Hilbert space and demands for an extension of existing regularization theory. We develop a stable reconstruction procedure by applying Bayesian inversion to this setting. We use an appropriate binomial prior which takes the integer setting for the number of Maxwell elements into account and at the same time computes the underlying material parameters. We extend the regularization theory for inverse problems to this special setup and prove existence, stability and convergence of the computed solution.

While exact solvers provide robust upwinding fluxes, their high computational cost necessitates approximate solvers. Although approximate solvers achieve accuracy in many scenarios, they produce inaccurate solutions in certain cases. To overcome this limitation, we propose constructing neural network-based surrogate models, trained using supervised learning, designed to map interior and exterior conservative state variables to the corresponding exact flux. Specifically, we propose two distinct approaches: one utilizing a vanilla neural network and the other employing a bi-fidelity neural network. The performance of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through applications to one-dimensional and two-dimensional partial differential equations, showcasing their robustness and accuracy.",NA,NA,0,1

In the case of a cubic nonlinearity, we show almost second-order convergence in $L^2$ and almost first-order convergence in $H^1$. If the nonlinearity has a quartic form instead, we show an analogous convergence result with an order reduced by 1/2. To our knowledge these are the best convergence results available for the 3D cubic and quartic wave equations under the finite-energy condition. Our approach relies on continuous- and discrete-time Strichartz estimates. We also make use of the integration and summation by parts formulas to exploit cancellations in the error terms.

To address this limitation, we propose a localized DMD framework that improves prediction performance by integrating DMD's strong short-term forecasting capabilities with time-domain decomposition techniques. Our approach segments the time domain of the dynamical system, independently constructing snapshot matrices and performing localized predictions within each segment. We first introduce a localized DMD method with predefined partitioning, which is simple to implement, and then extend it to an adaptive partitioning strategy that enhances prediction accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis that provides the upper bound of the local and global truncation error for our method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to four benchmark problems: Burgers' equation, the Allen-Cahn equation, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, and Maxwell's equations.

In this work, the effect of FD perturbations on the performance of TR-based design is evaluated on a case study basis concerning a total of 80 optimizations of a planar antenna structure. The obtained results demonstrate that, for the considered radiator, the performance of the final designs obtained using different FD setups may vary by as much as 18 dB (and by over 4 dB on average).

The key idea lies in reformulating the high-dimensional nonlinear wave kinetic operator as a spherical integral, analogous to classical Boltzmann collision operator. The conservation of mass and momentum leads to a double convolution structure in Fourier space, which can be efficiently handled using the fast Fourier transform.

An ``irreducible"" network is one whose function cannot be represented by another network with fewer neurons. For ReLU activation functions, we first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for determining the irreducibility of a network. Subsequently, we prove a negative result: finite samples are insufficient for definitive identification of any irreducible ReLU shallow network. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that for a given irreducible network, one can construct a finite set of sampling points that can distinguish it from other network with the same neuron count. Conversely, for logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activation functions, we provide a positive result. We construct finite samples that enable the recovery of two-layer irreducible shallow analytic networks.

A major challenge in $hr$-adaptive finite element methods lies in projecting the previous step's finite element solution onto the updated mesh. This projection depends on the new mesh and must be recomputed for each adaptive iteration. To address this, we introduce a neural network to construct a mesh-free surrogate of the previous step finite element solution. Since the neural network is mesh-free, it only requires training once per time step, with its parameters initialized using the optimizer from the previous time step. This approach effectively overcomes the interpolation challenges associated with non-nested meshes in computation, making node insertion and movement more convenient and efficient. The new algorithm also emphasizes SIZING and GENERATE, allowing each refinement to roughly double the number of mesh nodes of the previous iteration and then redistribute them to form a new mesh that effectively captures the singularities. It significantly reduces the time required for repeated refinement and achieves the desired accuracy in no more than seven space-adaptive iterations per time step. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in capturing dynamic changes of singularities.",NA,NA,0,1

The dissipation operators can be readily applied to any scheme that uses the SBP framework, including high-order entropy-stable schemes. Additionally, we clarify the incorporation of a variable coefficient within the operator structure and analyze the impact of a boundary correction matrix on operator structure and accuracy. Following the theoretical development and construction of novel dissipation operators, we relate the presented volume dissipation to the use of upwind SBP operators. While we focus on finite-difference methods, our framework also applies to spectral-element methods, in which case we obtain unique dissipation operators that can also be derived through alternative approaches involving orthogonal polynomials. Numerical examples featuring the linear convection, Burgers, and Euler equations verify the properties of the constructed dissipation operators and assess their performance compared to existing upwind SBP schemes, including linear stability behaviour.

This study evaluates 20 machine learning methods across three reliability regimes full range (0.0-1.0), high reliability (0.9-1.0), and ultra high reliability (0.99-1.0) to address these gaps. We demonstrate that large-scale networks with arc reliability larger than or equal to 0.9 exhibit near-unity system reliability, enabling computational simplifications. Further, we establish a dataset-scale-driven paradigm for algorithm selection: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) excel with limited data, while Polynomial Regression (PR) achieves superior accuracy in data-rich environments. Our findings reveal ANN's Test-MSE of 7.24E-05 at 30,000 samples and PR's optimal performance (5.61E-05) at 40,000 samples, outperforming traditional Monte Carlo simulations. These insights provide actionable guidelines for balancing accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency in reliability engineering, with implications for infrastructure resilience and system optimization.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.12474v1,Ensemble Kalman-Bucy filtering for nonlinear model predictive control,Sebastian Reich,"We consider the problem of optimal control for partially observed dynamical systems. Despite its prevalence in practical applications, there are still very few algorithms available, which take uncertainties in the current state estimates and future observations into account. In other words, most current approaches separate state estimation from the optimal control problem. In this paper, we extend the popular ensemble Kalman filter to receding horizon optimal control problems in the spirit of nonlinear model predictive control. We provide an interacting particle approximation to the forward-backward stochastic differential equations arising from Pontryagin's maximum principle with the forward stochastic differential equation provided by the time-continuous ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter equations. The receding horizon control laws are approximated as linear and are continuously updated as in nonlinear model predictive control. We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology for an inverted pendulum example.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.12473v1,Oscillation-eliminating central DG schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws,Manting Peng; Kailiang Wu; Caiyou Yuan,"This paper proposes and analyzes a class of essentially non-oscillatory central discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) methods for general hyperbolic conservation laws. First, we introduce a novel compact, non-oscillatory stabilization mechanism that effectively suppresses spurious oscillations while preserving the high-order accuracy of CDG methods. Unlike existing limiter-based approaches that rely on large stencils or problem-specific parameters for oscillation control, our dual damping mechanism is inspired by CDG-based numerical dissipation and leverages overlapping solutions within the CDG framework, significantly enhancing stability while maintaining compactness. Our approach is free of problem-dependent parameters and complex characteristic decomposition, making it efficient and robust. Second, we provide a rigorous stability and optimal error analysis for fully discrete Runge-Kutta (RK) CDG schemes, addressing a gap in the theoretical understanding of these methods. Specifically, we establish the approximate skew-symmetry and weak boundedness of the CDG discretization. These results enable us to rigorously analyze the fully discrete error estimates for our oscillation-eliminating CDG (OECDG) method, a challenging task due to its nonlinear nature, even for linear advection equations. Building on this framework, we reformulate nonlinear oscillation-eliminating CDG schemes as linear RK CDG schemes with a nonlinear source term, extending error estimates beyond the linear case to schemes with nonlinear oscillation control. While existing error analyses for DG or CDG schemes have largely been restricted to linear cases without nonlinear oscillation-control techniques, our analysis represents an important theoretical advancement. Experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the OECDG method.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.12465v1,On Local Minimum Entropy Principle of High-Order Schemes for Relativistic Euler Equations,Shumo Cui; Kailiang Wu; Linfeng Xu,"This paper establishes the minimum entropy principle (MEP) for the relativistic Euler equations with a broad class of equations of state (EOSs) and addresses the challenge of preserving the local version of the discovered MEP in high-order numerical schemes. At the continuous level, we find out a family of entropy pairs for the relativistic Euler equations and provide rigorous analysis to prove the strict convexity of entropy under a necessary and sufficient condition. At the numerical level, we develop a rigorous framework for designing provably entropy-preserving high-order schemes that ensure both physical admissibility and the discovered MEP. The relativistic effects, coupled with the abstract and general EOS formulation, introduce significant challenges not encountered in the nonrelativistic case or with the ideal EOS. In particular, entropy is a highly nonlinear and implicit function of the conservative variables, making it particularly difficult to enforce entropy preservation. To address these challenges, we establish a series of auxiliary theories via highly technical inequalities. Another key innovation is the use of geometric quasi-linearization (GQL), which reformulates the nonlinear constraints into equivalent linear ones by introducing additional free parameters. These advancements form the foundation of our entropy-preserving analysis. We propose novel, robust, locally entropy-preserving high-order frameworks. A central challenge is accurately estimating the local minimum of entropy, particularly in the presence of shock waves at unknown locations. To address this, we introduce two new approaches for estimating local lower bounds of specific entropy, which prove effective for both smooth and discontinuous problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our entropy-preserving methods maintain high-order accuracy while effectively suppressing spurious oscillations.",NA,NA,0,1

Green; El Mostafa Kalmoun,"We present a unified numerical method to determine the shapes of multiple Hele-Shaw bubbles in steady motion, and in the absence of surface tension, in three planar domains: free space, the upper half-plane, and an infinite channel. Our approach is based on solving the free boundary problem for the bubble boundaries using a fast and accurate boundary integral method. The main advantage of our method is that it allows for the treatment of a very high number of bubbles. The presented method is validated by recovering some existing results for steady bubbles in channels and free space. Several numerical examples are presented, many of which feature configurations of bubbles that have not appeared in the literature before.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.12403v1,A Parametric Family of Polynomial Wavelets for Signal and Image Processing,Mariantonia Cotronei; Woula Themistoclakis; Marc Van Barel,"This paper investigates the potential applications of a parametric family of polynomial wavelets that has been recently introduced starting from de la Vall\'ee Poussin (VP) interpolation at Chebyshev nodes. Unlike classical wavelets, which are constructed on the real line, these VP wavelets are defined on a bounded interval, offering the advantage of handling boundaries naturally while maintaining computational efficiency. In fact, the structure of these wavelets enables the use of fast algorithms for decomposition and reconstruction. Furthermore, the flexibility offered by a free parameter allows a better control of localized singularities, such as edges in images. On the basis of previous theoretical foundations, we show the effectiveness of the VP wavelets for basic signal denoising and image compression, emphasizing their potential for more advanced signal and image processing tasks.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.12397v1,A free parameter depending family of polynomial wavelets on a compact interval,Woula Themistoclakis; Marc Van Barel,"On a compact interval, we introduce and study a whole family of wavelets depending on a free parameter that can be suitably modulated to improve performance. Such wavelets arise from de la Vall\'ee Poussin (VP) interpolation at Chebyshev nodes, generalizing previous work by Capobianco and Themistoclakis who considered a special parameter setting. In our construction, both scaling and wavelet functions are interpolating polynomials at some Chebyshev zeros of 1st kind. Contrarily to the classical approach, they are not generated by dilations and translations of a single mother function and are naturally defined on the interval $[-1,1]$ to which any other compact interval can be reduced. In the paper, we provide a non-standard multiresolution analysis with fast (DCT-based) decomposition and reconstruction algorithms. Moreover, we state several theoretical results, particularly on convergence, laying the foundation for future applications.",NA,NA,0,1

This approach combines a semi-implicit scheme for fluid flow, governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with an optimization-based approach for heat transfer across the fluid-solid interface. In the semi-implicit method, the convective term in the momentum equation is treated explicitly, ensuring computational efficiency, while maintaining stability when a CFL condition involving fluid velocity is satisfied. Heat exchange between the fluid and solid domains is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, which is efficiently solved using a sequential quadratic programming method. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.12295v1,Towards Learning High-Precision Least Squares Algorithms with Sequence Models,Jerry Liu; Jessica Grogan; Owen Dugan; Ashish Rao; Simran Arora; Atri Rudra; Christopher Ré,"This paper investigates whether sequence models can learn to perform numerical algorithms, e.g. gradient descent, on the fundamental problem of least squares. Our goal is to inherit two properties of standard algorithms from numerical analysis: (1) machine precision, i.e. we want to obtain solutions that are accurate to near floating point error, and (2) numerical generality, i.e. we want them to apply broadly across problem instances. We find that prior approaches using Transformers fail to meet these criteria, and identify limitations present in existing architectures and training procedures. First, we show that softmax Transformers struggle to perform high-precision multiplications, which prevents them from precisely learning numerical algorithms. Second, we identify an alternate class of architectures, comprised entirely of polynomials, that can efficiently represent high-precision gradient descent iterates. Finally, we investigate precision bottlenecks during training and address them via a high-precision training recipe that reduces stochastic gradient noise. Our recipe enables us to train two polynomial architectures, gated convolutions and linear attention, to perform gradient descent iterates on least squares problems. For the first time, we demonstrate the ability to train to near machine precision. Applied iteratively, our models obtain 100,000x lower MSE than standard Transformers trained end-to-end and they incur a 10,000x smaller generalization gap on out-of-distribution problems. We make progress towards end-to-end learning of numerical algorithms for least squares.",NA,NA,0,1

An analysis of the convergence and approximation error of the proposed regularized inverse Born series is provided.

2503.12262v1,Improving Wolbachia-Based Control Programs in Urban Settings: Insights from Spatial Modeling,Daniela Florez; Ricardo Cortez; James M. Hyman; Zhuolin Qu,"Arboviral diseases remain a major public health concern, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where mosquito populations thrive. One promising strategy to curb transmission is the release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia, a bacterium that reduces their ability to spread viruses. However, past large-scale releases have not always been successful, especially in complex urban settings, where restricted access to certain areas often leads to infection establishment failures and wasted resources. To address this, we developed and analyzed a partial differential equation model that simulates how Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are established in different urban environments. We also explored strategies to improve their success under constraints on release size and the efficacy level of insecticide used for pre-release interventions. Our findings suggest that targeted releases are most effective in areas with limited mosquito movement without additional insecticide use. In higher mosquito dispersal areas, reducing at least 35% of wild mosquitoes before release significantly improves establishment within nine months. Additionally, distributing releases over 2-5 weekly batches enhances success more than a single large release, even without other interventions. These findings offer practical insights for designing cost-effective and efficient Wolbachia-based mosquito control programs, reducing the burden of mosquito-borne diseases on vulnerable communities.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.12240v1,A Lagrange multiplier formulation for the fully dynamic Navier-Stokes-Biot system,Xing Wang; Ivan Yotov,"We study a mathematical model of fluid -- poroelastic structure interaction and its numerical solution. The free fluid region is governed by the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, while the poroelastic region is modeled by the Biot system of poroelasticity. The two systems are coupled along an interface through continuity of normal velocity and stress and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman slip with friction condition. The variables in the weak formulation are velocity and pressure for Navier-Stokes, displacement for elasticity and velocity and pressure for Darcy flow. A Lagrange multiplier of stress/pressure type is employed to impose weakly the continuity of flux. Existence, uniqueness, and stability of a weak solution is established under a small data assumption. A fully discrete numerical method is then developed, based on backward Euler time discretization and finite element spatial approximation. We establish solvability, stability, and error estimates for the fully discrete scheme. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical results and illustrate the performance of the method for an arterial flow application.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.12117v1,The Exact Geometry of Numerical Error: Cyclic Groups and Deterministic Bias,William Cook,"The Universal Bias Framework (UBF) introduces a novel perspective on numerical integration errors for periodic $C^2[0,1]$ functions evaluated on uniform grids. We prove that within this domain, what has traditionally been treated through asymptotic bounds is in fact a deterministic signal governed by the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/P\mathbb{Z}$. For \[ f(x)=\sin^2(2\pi kx) \] on a uniform grid of $P$ points, we derive the exact bias formula: \[ \mathcal{B}_P[f] = -\frac{1}{2}\chi\left(\frac{2k}{P}\right) + \frac{\sin(4\pi k)}{8\pi k}, \] where $\chi$ functions as a resonance detector, encoding grid-frequency interactions -- spiking at integer ratios of $k/P$ and vanishing at partial resonances. This is not an approximation; it is an exact solution validated to machine precision ($10^{-16}$).   For periodic $C^2[0,1]$ functions, the bias exhibits a fractal-like structure at rational $k/P$ values, with resonance peaks organised in a Farey fraction hierarchy. This establishes a connection between numerical error and number theory, unifying integration and spectral analysis through a common algebraic structure.   The framework's predictive power extends to real-world applications -- our analysis shows it could have anticipated the error accumulation in the 1991 Patriot missile failure 61 hours before the critical threshold. UBF provides a foundation for precise error prediction in domains where periodic functions on uniform grids are relevant, including signal processing, quantum simulation, and computational mechanics, transforming error from an obstacle to be bounded into a signal to be leveraged.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.12110v1,A numerical method based on quasi-Lagrangian Voronoi cells for two-phase flows with large density contrast,Ondřej Kincl; Ilya Peshkov; Walter Boscheri,"In this work, we use a moving Voronoi and sharp interface approach for simulating two-phase flows. At every time step, the mesh is generated anew from Voronoi seeds that behave as material points. The paper is a continuation of our previous works on moving Voronoi meshes where we have considered single phase incompressible and compressible flows. In the context of quasi-Lagrangian Voronoi simulations, problems with large density contrasts (such as water and air interface) are being treated here for the first time to the best of our knowledge. This is made possible through a remapping stage, which relies on a filtering of a color function. The resulting semi-implicit scheme is conservative and robust, allowing us to simulate both compressible and incompressible flows, including shock waves and surface tension.",NA,NA,0,1

Compared to conventional Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) and remote sensing-based flow monitoring, the proposed method enables high-resolution, continuous water velocity measurement, making it well-suited for hazardous environments such as floods, strong currents, and sediment-laden rivers. Building upon the original approach, we develop an enhanced model that incorporates multiple emission directions and flexible configurations of receivers. These advancements improve the adaptability and accuracy of the method when applied to three-dimensional flow fields. To evaluate its feasibility, we conducted extensive numerical simulations designed to mimic real-world hydrodynamic conditions.

2503.13526v1,Time parallelization for hyperbolic and parabolic problems,Martin J. Gander; Shu-Lin Wu; Tao Zhou,"Time parallelization, also known as PinT (Parallel-in-Time) is a new research direction for the development of algorithms used for solving very large scale evolution problems on highly parallel computing architectures. Despite the fact that interesting theoretical work on PinT appeared as early 1964, it was not until 2004, when processor clock speeds reached their physical limit, that research in PinT took off. A distinctive characteristic of parallelization in time is that information flow only goes forward in time, meaning that time evolution processes seem necessarily to be sequential. Nevertheless, many algorithms have been developed over the last two decades to do PinT computations, and they are often grouped into four basic classes according to how the techniques work and are used: shooting-type methods; waveform relaxation methods based on domain decomposition; multigrid methods in space-time; and direct time parallel methods. However, over the past few years, it has been recognized that highly successful PinT algorithms for parabolic problems struggle when applied to hyperbolic problems. We focus in this survey therefore on this important aspect, by first providing a summary of the fundamental differences between parabolic and hyperbolic problems for time parallelization. We then group PinT algorithms into two basic groups: the first group contains four effective PinT techniques for hyperbolic problems, namely Schwarz Waveform Relaxation with its relation to Tent Pitching; Parallel Integral Deferred Correction; ParaExp; and ParaDiag. While the methods in the first group also work well for parabolic problems, we then present PinT methods especially designed for parabolic problems in the second group: Parareal: the Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space-Time; Multigrid Reduction in Time; and Space-Time Multigrid.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.11884v1,Mixing Condition Numbers and Oracles for Accurate Floating-point Debugging,Bhargav Kulkarni; Pavel Panchekha,"Recent advances have made numeric debugging tools much faster by using double-double oracles, and numeric analysis tools much more accurate by using condition numbers. But these techniques have downsides: double-double oracles have correlated error so miss floating-point errors while condition numbers cannot cleanly handle over- and under- flow. We combine both techniques to avoid these downsides. Our combination, EXPLANIFLOAT, computes condition numbers using double-double arithmetic, which avoids correlated errors. To handle over- and under- flow, it introduces a separate logarithmic oracle. As a result, EXPLANIFLOAT achieves a precision of 80.0% and a recall of 96.1% on a collection of 546 difficult numeric benchmarks: more accurate than double-double oracles yet dramatically faster than arbitrary-precision condition number computations.",NA,NA,0,1

For this reason, this work proposes the partial implementation of fractional operators in polynomial regression models to generate a fractional regression model. The goal of this proposal is to attempt to mitigate overfitting, which could improve the value of the coefficient of determination for unseen data, compared to the polynomial model, under the assumption that this would contribute to generating predictive models with better performance. The methodology for constructing these fractional regression models is detailed, and examples applicable to both Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional operators are presented.",NA,NA,0,1

Their theoretical analyses and numerical experiments suggest that the presented methods can attain root-exponential convergence. However, the convergence of these methods has not been strictly proved. This study first improves their methods to make them easier to implement, and provides a convergence theorem of the improved method. For the same equations, another Sinc-collocation method was proposed in 2016. This method is regarded as an improvement in the variable transformation employed in the method proposed in 2012.

The dynamical core has recently been developed by the Met Office and uses an iterated-semi-implicit time discretisation and mixed finite-element spatial discretisation.   The essential part of the adaptation is the addition of the LBCs to the right-hand-side of the linear system which solves for pressure and momentum simultaneously. The impacts on the associated Helmholtz preconditioner and multigrid techniques are also described.   The regional version of the dynamical core is validated through big-brother experiments based on idealised dynamical core tests. These experiments demonstrate that the subdomain results are consistent with those from the full domain, confirming the correct application of LBCs. Inconsistencies arise in cases where the LBCs are not perfect, but it is shown that the application of blending can be used to overcome these problems.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.11523v1,Superconvergent Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Scalar Teukolsky Equation on Hyperboloidal Domains: Efficient Waveform and Self-Force Computation,Manas Vishal; Scott E. Field; Sigal Gottlieb; Jennifer Ryan,"The long-time evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspiral systems requires minimal phase and dispersion errors to accurately compute far-field waveforms, while high accuracy is essential near the smaller black hole (modeled as a Dirac delta distribution) for self-force computations. Spectrally accurate methods, such as nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, are well suited for these tasks. Their numerical errors typically decrease as $\propto (\Delta x)^{N+1}$, where $\Delta x$ is the subdomain size and $N$ is the polynomial degree of the approximation. However, certain DG schemes exhibit superconvergence, where truncation, phase, and dispersion errors can decrease as fast as $\propto (\Delta x)^{2N+1}$. Superconvergent numerical solvers are, by construction, extremely efficient and accurate. We theoretically demonstrate that our DG scheme for the scalar Teukolsky equation with a distributional source is superconvergent, and this property is retained when combined with the hyperboloidal layer compactification technique. This ensures that waveforms, total energy and angular-momentum fluxes, and self-force computations benefit from superconvergence. We empirically verify this behavior across a family of hyperboloidal layer compactifications with varying degrees of smoothness. Additionally, we show that self-force quantities for circular orbits, computed at the point particle's location, also exhibit a certain degree of superconvergence. Our results underscore the potential benefits of numerical superconvergence for efficient and accurate gravitational waveform simulations based on DG methods.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.11493v1,Normal-normal continuous symmetric stresses in mixed finite element elasticity,Carsten Carstensen; Norbert Heuer,"The classical continuous mixed formulation of linear elasticity with pointwise symmetric stresses allows for a conforming finite element discretization with piecewise polynomials of degree at least three. Symmetric stress approximations of lower polynomial order are only possible when their div-conformity is weakened to the continuity of normal-normal components. In two dimensions, this condition is meant pointwise along edges for piecewise polynomials, but a corresponding characterization for general piecewise H(div) tensors has been elusive. We introduce such a space and establish a continuous mixed formulation of linear planar elasticity with pointwise symmetric stresses that have, in a distributional sense, continuous normal-normal components across the edges of a shape-regular triangulation. The displacement is split into an $L_2$ field and a tangential trace on the skeleton of the mesh. The well-posedness of the new mixed formulation follows with a duality lemma relating the normal-normal continuous stresses with the tangential traces of displacements. For this new formulation we present a lowest-order conforming discretization. Stresses are approximated by piecewise quadratic symmetric tensors, whereas displacements are discretized by piecewise linear polynomials. The tangential displacement trace acts as a Lagrange multiplier and guarantees global div-conformity in the limit as the mesh-size tends to zero. We prove locking-free, quasi-optimal convergence of our scheme and illustrate this with numerical examples.",NA,NA,0,1

Based on this framework, we propose several second-order semi-discrete schemes that maintain linearity, computational decoupling, and unconditional energy stability. Firstly, for dissipative systems with known energy lower bounds, we introduce a positive auxiliary variable $V(t)$ to substitute the total energy functional, subsequently discretizing it on staggered temporal meshes to ensure that the energy remains non-increasing regardless of the size of time step. The newly developed schemes achieve full computational decoupling, maintaining essentially the same computational expense as conventional implicit-explicit methods while demonstrating significantly improved accuracy. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the positivity preservation of the discrete variable $V^{n+1/2}$ which is a crucial property ensuring numerical stability and accuracy. Theoretical analysis confirms second-order temporal convergence for the proposed SM schemes. Secondly, for dissipative systems lacking well-defined energy lower bounds, we devise an alternative auxiliary variable formulation and extend the SM framework to maintain unconditional energy stability while preserving numerical effectiveness and accuracy. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments, including benchmark problem simulations, validate the proposed schemes' efficacy and demonstrate their superior performance characteristics.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

HHO methods rely on a pair of unknowns, combining polynomials attached to the mesh faces and the mesh cells. In the unfitted framework, the interface can cut through the mesh cells in a very general fashion, and the polynomial unknowns are doubled in the cut cells and the cut faces. In order to avoid the ill-conditioning issues caused by the presence of small cut cells, the novel approach introduced herein is to use polynomial extensions in the definition of the gradient reconstruction operator. Stability and consistency results are established, leading to optimally decaying error estimates. The theory is illustrated by numerical experiments.",NA,NA,0,1

A correction to the Riemann solver is introduced, designed to mitigate excessive numerical diffusion while maintaining simplicity and efficiency. The validity of this correction is established through rigorous asymptotic analysis of the governing equations and their discrete counterparts.

Our method requires at least $C^1$-regularity in time, and it is shown to be unconditionally stable for all choices of discrete spaces that satisfy standard approximation properties and inverse inequalities, such as spline spaces. In particular, the variational formulation of the associated ordinary differential equation is coercive. The proposed method yields error estimates with respect to the mesh size that are suboptimal by one order in standard Sobolev norms. However, for certain choices of approximation spaces, it achieves quasi-optimal estimates. In particular, we prove this for $C^1$-regular splines of even polynomial degree, and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the same behavior holds for splines with maximal regularity, irrespective of the degree. Numerical results are provided to support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the sharpness of the estimates.",NA,NA,0,1

Mamonov,"In this paper we develop a numerical method for solving an inverse scattering problem of estimating the scattering potential in a Schr\""{o}dinger equation from frequency domain measurements based on reduced order models (ROM). The ROM is a projection of Schr\""{o}dinger operator onto a subspace spanned by its solution snapshots at certain wavenumbers. Provided the measurements are performed at these wavenumbers, the ROM can be constructed in a data-driven manner from the measurements on a surface surrounding the scatterers. Once the ROM is computed, the scattering potential can be estimated using non-linear optimization that minimizes the ROM misfit. Such an approach typically outperforms the conventional methods based on data misfit minimization. We develop two variants of ROM-based algorithms for inverse scattering and test them on a synthetic example in two spatial dimensions.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.10824v1,On the representation of energy-preserving quadratic operators with application to Operator Inference,Leonidas Gkimisis; Igor Pontes Duff; Pawan Goyal; Peter Benner,"In this work, we investigate a skew-symmetric parameterization for energy-preserving quadratic operators. Earlier, [Goyal et al., 2023] proposed this parameterization to enforce energy-preservation for quadratic terms in the context of dynamical system data-driven inference. We here prove that every energy-preserving quadratic term can be equivalently formulated using a parameterization of the corresponding operator via skew-symmetric matrix blocks. Based on this main finding, we develop an algorithm to compute an equivalent quadratic operator with skew-symmetric sub-matrices, given an arbitrary energy-preserving operator. Consequently, we employ the skew-symmetric sub-matrix representation in the framework of non-intrusive reduced-order modeling (ROM) via Operator Inference (OpInf) for systems with an energy-preserving nonlinearity. To this end, we propose a sequential, linear least-squares (LS) problems formulation for the inference task, to ensure energy-preservation of the data-driven quadratic operator. The potential of this approach is indicated by the numerical results for a 2D Burgers' equation benchmark, compared to classical OpInf.

2503.10812v1,Understanding Contrastive Learning through Variational Analysis and Neural Network Optimization Perspectives,Jeff Calder; Wonjun Lee,"The SimCLR method for contrastive learning of invariant visual representations has become extensively used in supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised settings, due to its ability to uncover patterns and structures in image data that are not directly present in the pixel representations. However, the reason for this success is not well-explained, since it is not guaranteed by invariance alone. In this paper, we conduct a mathematical analysis of the SimCLR method with the goal of better understanding the geometric properties of the learned latent distribution. Our findings reveal two things: (1) the SimCLR loss alone is not sufficient to select a good minimizer -- there are minimizers that give trivial latent distributions, even when the original data is highly clustered -- and (2) in order to understand the success of contrastive learning methods like SimCLR, it is necessary to analyze the neural network training dynamics induced by minimizing a contrastive learning loss. Our preliminary analysis for a one-hidden layer neural network shows that clustering structure can present itself for a substantial period of time during training, even if it eventually converges to a trivial minimizer. To substantiate our theoretical insights, we present numerical results that confirm our theoretical predictions.",NA,NA,0,1

However, its practical utility hinges on optimizing design parameters-such as syndrome measurement frequency-to avoid diminishing returns from detection overhead. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for fault-tolerant compilation and simulation of quantum algorithms using [[n, n-2, 2]] codes, which enable low-qubit-overhead error detection and a simple nearly fault-tolerant universal set of operations. We demonstrate and analyze our pipeline with a purely statistical interpretation and through the implementation of Grover's search algorithm. Our results are used to answer the question is quantum error detection a worthwhile avenue for early-term fault tolerance, and if so how can we get the most out of it? Simulations under the circuit-level noise model reveal that finding optimal syndrome schedules improves algorithm success probabilities by an average of 6.7x but eventual statistical limits from post-selection in noisy/resource-limited regimes constrain scalability. Furthermore, we propose a simple data-driven approach to predict fault tolerant compilation parameters, such as optimal syndrome schedules, and expected fault tolerant performance gains based on circuit and noise features. These results provide actionable guidelines for implementing QED in early-term quantum experiments and underscore its role as a pragmatic, constant-overhead error mitigation layer for shallow algorithms.

These immune cells are attracted to the wound after an injury and they move showing both directional and random motion. Thus, first, we smooth the trajectories and we separate the random from the directional parts of the motion. The smoothing model is based on curve evolution where the curve motion is influenced by the smoothing term and the attracting term. Once we obtain the random sub-trajectories, we analyze them using the mean squared displacement to characterize the type of diffusion. Finally, we compute the velocities on the smoothed trajectories and use them as sparse samples to reconstruct the wound attractant field. To do that, we consider a minimization problem for the vector components and lengths, which leads to solving the Laplace equation with Dirichlet conditions for the sparse samples and zero Neumann boundary conditions on the domain boundary.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

The formulation is provided in matrix notation in detail. The use of a director vector, as opposed to multi-parameter shell models, significantly reduces the computational cost by minimizing the number of degrees of freedom. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of the spectral element method (SEM) in combination with Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre quadrature regarding the computational costs to generate the element stiffness matrix. To assess the performance of the new formulation for large deformation analysis, we compare it to three other numerical methods. One of these methods is a non-isoparametric SEM shell using the geometry definition of isogeometric analysis (IGA), while the other two are IGA shell formulations which differ in the rotation interpolation. All formulations base on Rodrigues' rotation tensor. Through the solution of various challenging numerical examples, it is demonstrated that although IGA benefits from an exact geometric representation, its influence on solution accuracy is less significant than that of shape function characteristics and rotational formulations. Furthermore, we show that the proposed SEM shell, despite its simpler rotational formulation, can produce results comparable to the most accurate and complex version of IGA. Finally, we discuss the optimal SEM strategy, emphasizing the effectiveness of employing coarser meshes with higher-order elements.",NA,NA,0,1

In this work, we give a detailed account on the consistency of Maximum Likelihood based empirical risk minimization for a generic class of target measures. In contrast to prior work, we do not only consider the statistical learning theory, but also give a detailed numerical analysis of the NeuralODE algorithm based on the 2nd order Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage optimization method based on optimal control theory and variational Bayesian methods. This method not only achieves stable solutions for stochastic inverse problems but also efficiently quantifies the uncertainty of the solutions.

Our methods, relying on rational approximation, aim at building surrogate models of what we call ""field amplification"", defined as the norm of the solution operator of the scattering problem, which we express through boundary-integral equations. To provide our techniques with theoretical foundations, we first derive results linking the field amplification to the spectral properties of the operator that defines the scattering problem. Such results are then used to justify the use of rational approximation in the surrogate-modeling task. Some of our proposed methods apply rational approximation in a ""standard"" way, building a rational approximant for either the solution operator directly or, in the interest of computational efficiency, for a randomly ""sketched"" version of it. Our other ""hybrid"" approaches are more innovative, combining rational-approximation-assisted root-finding with approximation using radial basis functions. Three key features of our methods are that (i) they are agnostic of the strategy used to discretize the scattering problem, (ii) they do not require any computations involving non-real wavenumbers, and (iii) they can adjust to different settings through the use of adaptive sampling strategies.

GNQC generalizes the classical nonlocal Quasicontinuum framework by eliminating the assumption of affine or high-order deformation patterns for accurate energy sampling in coarse-grained regions and by ensuring consistency with general finite element shape functions used for coarse-graining. The introduced GNQC method offers three key features: (1) a constitutive-model-consistent framework that employs the same lattice constitutive relationship in both the locally full-resolution region and the coarse-grained domain, similar to existing nonlocal QC approaches; (2) a shape-function consistent energy sampling mechanism that aligns with the interpolation order of the generally employed shape functions, differing significantly from existing Quasicontinuum works and substantially reducing computational costs; and (3) consistent interfacial compatibility, which enables seamless energy and force transfer across interfaces between regions of different resolutions without cumbersome interfacial treatments.

We prove that as the sampling mesh size tends to zero, the controlled state process converges weakly to the dynamics with coefficients aggregated according to the stochastic policy. We explicitly quantify the convergence rate based on the regularity of the coefficients and establish an optimal first-order convergence rate for sufficiently regular coefficients. Additionally, we show that the same convergence rates hold with high probability concerning the sampling noise, and further establish a $1/2$-order almost sure convergence when the volatility is not controlled. Building on these results, we analyze the bias and variance of various policy evaluation and policy gradient estimators based on discrete-time observations.

This expression, as well as simple modifications of it, does not correctly capture the saturation throughput values when an arbitrary topology is specified for the conflict graph between transmitting links. For example, we show numerically that calculations based on renewal theory can underestimate throughput by 48-62% for large packet sizes when the conflict graph is represented by a star topology. This is problematic because real-world wireless networks, such as wireless IoT mesh networks, are often deployed over a large area, resulting in non-complete conflict graphs.   To address this gap, we present a computational approach based on a novel Markov chain formulation that yields the exact saturation throughput for each node in the general network case for any given set of access probabilities, as well as a more compact expression for the special case where the packet length is twice the slot length. Using our approach, we show how the transmit probabilities could be optimized to maximize weighted utility functions of the saturation throughput values.

In order to design an appropriate numerical scheme for control realization, a coupled forward-backward system is derived based on the associated optimality conditions. The forward equation, corresponding to the Fokker-Planck dynamics, is discretized using a structure preserving scheme able to capture steady states. On the other hand, the backward equation, modeled as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman problem, is solved via a semi-Lagrangian scheme that supports large time steps while preserving stability. Coupling between the forward and backward problems is achieved through a gradient descent optimization strategy, ensuring convergence to the optimal control. Numerical experiments demonstrate second-order accuracy, computational efficiency, and effectiveness in controlling different examples across various scenarios in social dynamics. This approach provides a reliable computational tool for the study of opinion manipulation and consensus formation in socially structured systems.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

The control of the restart parameter is a key task to accelerate convergence and to prevent the well-known stagnation phenomenon. We focus on the Proportional-Derivative GMRES (PD-GMRES), which has been derived using control-theoretic ideas in [Cuevas N\'u\~nez, Schaerer, and Bhaya (2018)] as a versatile method for modifying the restart parameter. Several variants of a quadtree-based geometric optimization approach are proposed to find a best choice of PD-GMRES parameters. We show that the optimized PD-GMRES performs well across a large number of matrix types and we observe superior performance as compared to major other GMRES-based iterative solvers. Moreover, we propose an extension of the PD-GMRES algorithm to further improve performance by controlling the range of values for the restart parameter.",NA,NA,0,1

While the state-of-the-art method provides a computational cost O(MN^4 log N), with N being the number of modes in each direction and M being the number of quadrature points on a hemisphere, our method reduces the cost to O(N^4 log N), removing the factor M, which could be large in our numerical tests. The method is applied in a numerical solver for the steady-state Boltzmann equation with quadratic collision operators.

2503.09478v2,P-Order: A Unified Convergence-Analysis Framework for Multivariate Iterative Methods,Xiangmin Jiao; Hongji Gao,"We propose P-order (Power-order), a unified, norm-independent framework for quantifying the convergence rates of iterative methods. Standard analyses based on Q-order are norm-dependent and require some uniformity of error reductions asymptotically. Although the Ortega--Rheinboldt R-order supports non-uniform (including non-monotonic sequences) and is norm-independent, it does not differentiate among various sublinear rates and has ambiguities for some superlinear rates. In contrast, our proposed framework parameterizes the convergence rate in direct analogy with asymptotic notation in combinatorial algorithm analysis (including little-$o$, big-$\Theta$, and little-$\omega$), thereby precisely distinguishing linear, sublinear (e.g., fractional-power), and superlinear (e.g., linearithmic) regimes. We also introduce two subclasses of P-order: Quasi-Uniform P-order (QUP) and Uniform P-order (UP), and show their relations with Q-order and R-order. We demonstrate the ease-of-use and flexibility of QUP-order by analyzing fixed-point iterations and show that P-order can provide tighter bounds on the convergence rate than R-order for both sublinearly and superlinearly convergent cases while avoiding some ambiguities in R-order. Furthermore, we present a refined analysis of Newton's method for nonlinear equations with a wide spectrum of sublinear and superlinear convergence rates (including a newly defined anit-liearithmic rate).",NA,NA,0,1

Our model case is a geodesic version of the explicit Euler method. Precise bounds are obtained in the case of Riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature. The approach is based on a cocoercivity property of the vector field adapted to manifolds from Euclidean space. It allows us to compare the new results to the corresponding well-known results in flat spaces, and in general we find that a non-zero curvature will deteriorate the stability region of the geodesic Euler method. The step size bounds depend on the distance traveled over a step from the initial point. Numerical examples for spheres and hyperbolic 2-space confirm that the bounds are tight.",NA,NA,0,1

Recently, Titsias \cite{Titsias2024} demonstrated that the inverse Fisher information matrix is the optimal preconditioner by minimizing the expected squared jump distance and proposed an adaptive scheme to estimate the Fisher matrix using the sampling history. In this paper, we apply the Fisher adaptive Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) to Bayesian inverse problems. Moreover, we provide a rigorous convergence rate analysis for the adaptive scheme used to estimate the Fisher matrix. To evaluate its performance, we use this algorithm to sample from posterior distributions in several Bayesian inverse problems. And compare its constructions with the standard adaptive Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (which employs the empirical covariance matrix of the posterior distribution as the preconditioner) and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) algorithm.

This process has established itself as a suitable joining tool for metallic materials due to its non-contact processing, short cycle times, and small heat-affected zones. One potential problem, however, is the formation of solidification cracks, which particularly affects alloys with a pronounced melting range. Since solidification cracking is influenced by both temperature and strain rate, precise measurement technologies are of crucial importance. For this purpose, as an experimental setup, a Controlled Tensile Weldability (CTW) test combined with a local deformation measurement technique is used.   The aim of the present work is the development of computational methods and software tools to numerically simulate the CTW. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from the experimental CTW. In this study, an austenitic stainless steel sheet is selected. A thermo-elastoplastic material behavior with temperature-dependent material parameters is assumed. The time-dependent problem is first discretized in time and then the resulting nonlinear problem is linearized with Newton's method. For the discretization in space, finite elements are used. In order to obtain a sufficiently accurate solution, a large number of finite elements has to be used. In each Newton step, this yields a large linear system of equations that has to be solved. Therefore, a highly parallel scalable solver framework, based on the software library PETSc, was used to solve this computationally challenging problem on a high-performance computing architecture. Finally, the experimental results and the numerical simulations are compared, showing to be qualitatively in good agreement.",NA,NA,0,1

Here, we assume that the multiple components of the system are invariant by rotation. Then, we use the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) spline to solve the nonlocal system.

The directional integral in the original problem is discretized with Legendre-Gauss quadrature. We furnish a rigorous proof of the solvability of this scheme and, to our best knowledge, conduct a comprehensive error analysis for the first time.

2503.09140v1,"On the impact of observation error correlations in data assimilation, with application to along-track altimeter data",Olivier Goux; Anthony Weaver; Selime Gürol; Oliver Guillet; Andrea Piacentini,"Data assimilation involves estimating the state of a system by combining observations from various sources with a background estimate of the state. The weights given to the observations and background state depend on their specified error covariance matrices. Observation errors are often assumed to be uncorrelated even though this assumption is inaccurate for many modern data-sets such as those from satellite observing systems. As methods allowing for a more realistic representation of observation-error correlations are emerging, our aim in this article is to provide insight on their expected impact in data assimilation. First, we use a simple idealised system to analyse the effect of observation-error correlations on the spectral characteristics of the solution. Next, we assess the relevance of these results in a more realistic setting in which simulated alongtrack (nadir) altimeter observations with correlated errors are assimilated in a global ocean model using a three-dimensional variational assimilation (3D-Var) method. Correlated observation errors are modelled in the 3D-Var system using a diffusion operator. When the correlation length scale of observation error is small compared to that of background error, inflating the observation-error variances can mitigate most of the negative effects from neglecting the observation-error correlations. Accounting for observation-error correlations in this situation still outperforms variance inflation since it allows small-scale information in the observations to be more effectively extracted and does not affect the convergence of the minimization. Conversely, when the correlation length scale of observation error is large compared to that of background error, the effect of observation-error correlations cannot be properly approximated with variance inflation. However, the correlation model needs to be constructed carefully to ensure the minimization problem is adequately conditioned so that a robust solution can be obtained. Practical ways to achieve this are discussed.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.09135v1,Using Co-Located Range and Doppler Radars for Initial Orbit Determination,Cristina Parigini; Laura Pirovano; Roberto Armellin; Darren McKnight; Adam Marsh; Tom Reddell,"With debris larger than 1 cm in size estimated to be over one million, precise cataloging efforts are essential to ensure space operations' safety. Compounding this challenge is the oversubscribed problem, where the sheer volume of space objects surpasses ground-based observatories' observational capacity. This results in sparse, brief observations and extended intervals before image acquisition. LeoLabs' network of phased-array radars addresses this need by reliably tracking 10 cm objects and larger in low Earth orbit with 10 independent radars across six sites. While LeoLabs tracklets are extremely short, they hold much more information than typical radar observations. Furthermore, two tracklets are generally available, separated by a couple of minutes. Thus, this paper develops a tailored approach to initialize state and uncertainty from a single or pair of tracklets. Through differential algebra, the initial orbit determination provides the state space compatible with the available measurements, namely an orbit set. This practice, widely used in previous research, allows for efficient data association of different tracklets, thus enabling the addition of accurate tracks to the catalog following their independent initialization. The algorithm's efficacy is tested using real measurements, evaluating the IOD solution's accuracy and ability to predict the next passage from a single or a pair of tracklets.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.09086v1,Numerical study on hyper parameter settings for neural network approximation to partial differential equations,Hee Jun Yang; Alexander Heinlein; Hyea Hyun Kim,"Approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) obtained by neural networks are highly affected by hyper parameter settings. For instance, the model training strongly depends on loss function design, including the choice of weight factors for different terms in the loss function, and the sampling set related to numerical integration; other hyper parameters, like the network architecture and the optimizer settings, also impact the model performance. On the other hand, suitable hyper parameter settings are known to be different for different model problems and currently no universal rule for the choice of hyper parameters is known.   In this paper, for second order elliptic model problems, various hyper parameter settings are tested numerically to provide a practical guide for efficient and accurate neural network approximation. While a full study of all possible hyper parameter settings is not possible, we focus on studying the formulation of the PDE loss as well as the incorporation of the boundary conditions, the choice of collocation points associated with numerical integration schemes, and various approaches for dealing with loss imbalances will be extensively studied on various model problems; in addition to various Poisson model problems, also a nonlinear and an eigenvalue problem are considered.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.09021v1,A deep learning approach to inverse medium scattering: Learning regularizers from a direct imaging method,Kai Li; Bo Zhang; Haiwen Zhang,"This paper aims to solve numerically the two-dimensional inverse medium scattering problem with far-field data. This is a challenging task due to the severe ill-posedness and strong nonlinearity of the inverse problem. As already known, it is necessary but also difficult numerically to employ an appropriate regularization strategy which effectively incorporates certain a priori information of the unknown scatterer to overcome the severe ill-posedness of the inverse problem. In this paper, we propose to use a deep learning approach to learn the a priori information of the support of the unknown scatterer from a direct imaging method. Based on the learned a priori information, we propose two inversion algorithms for solving the inverse problem. In the first one, the learned a priori information is incorporated into the projected Landweber method. In the second one, the learned a priori information is used to design the regularization functional for the regularized variational formulation of the inverse problem which is then solved with a traditional iteration algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments show that our inversion algorithms provide good reconstruction results even for the high contrast case and have a satisfactory generalization ability.",NA,NA,0,1

Here, we employ a Lotka-Volterra model to describe the two competing subpopulations, and we enclose this system within the ensemble control framework.

It is possible to say whether the batch has a defect rate, p, between 1.5 and 2%, or between 2 and 5%, or between 5 and 10%, and so on, until finding a required value for this probability. Using the two probabilities side by side, the Type I error for the lower probability distribution and the Type II error for the higher probability distribution, both can be controlled and minimized. It can be applied in the development or manufacturing process of a batch of components, or in the case of purchasing from a supplier, when the percentage of defects (p) is unknown, considering the technology and/or process available to obtain them.

2503.08465v1,A Ritz method for solution of parametric generalized EVPs,Joanna Bisch; Antti Hannukainen,"This work deals with approximate solution of generalized eigenvalue problem with coefficient matrix that is an affine function of d-parameters. The coefficient matrix is assumed to be symmetric positive definite and spectrally equivalent to an average matrix for all parameters in a given set. We develop a Ritz method for rapidly approximating the eigenvalues on the spectral interval of interest $(0,\Lambda)$ for given parameter value. The Ritz subspace is the same for all parameters and it is designed based on the observation that any eigenvector can be split into two components. The first component belongs to a subspace spanned by some eigenvectors of the average matrix. The second component is defined by a correction operator that is a d + 1 dimensional analytic function. We use this structure and build our Ritz subspace from eigenvectors of the average matrix and samples of the correction operator. The samples are evaluated at interpolation points related to a sparse polynomial interpolation method. We show that the resulting Ritz subspace can approximate eigenvectors of the original problem related to the spectral interval of interest with the same accuracy as the sparse polynomial interpolation approximates the correction operator. Bound for Ritz eigenvalue error follows from this and known results. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples.

2503.08343v1,Flexible and Efficient Probabilistic PDE Solvers through Gaussian Markov Random Fields,Tim Weiland; Marvin Pförtner; Philipp Hennig,"Mechanistic knowledge about the physical world is virtually always expressed via partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, there has been a surge of interest in probabilistic PDE solvers -- Bayesian statistical models mostly based on Gaussian process (GP) priors which seamlessly combine empirical measurements and mechanistic knowledge. As such, they quantify uncertainties arising from e.g. noisy or missing data, unknown PDE parameters or discretization error by design. Prior work has established connections to classical PDE solvers and provided solid theoretical guarantees. However, scaling such methods to large-scale problems remains a fundamental challenge primarily due to dense covariance matrices. Our approach addresses the scalability issues by leveraging the Markov property of many commonly used GP priors. It has been shown that such priors are solutions to stochastic PDEs (SPDEs) which when discretized allow for highly efficient GP regression through sparse linear algebra. In this work, we show how to leverage this prior class to make probabilistic PDE solvers practical, even for large-scale nonlinear PDEs, through greatly accelerated inference mechanisms. Additionally, our approach also allows for flexible and physically meaningful priors beyond what can be modeled with covariance functions. Experiments confirm substantial speedups and accelerated convergence of our physics-informed priors in nonlinear settings.",NA,NA,0,1

The method applies to any PDE for which both the domain to solve and the boundary condition (BC) type accept a planar symmetry, while no conditions are required on the BC values and the PDE right hand size function. It is applicable to finite element or finite difference method (FDM). It relies both on the specific construction of a mesh having a planar symmetry and a centrosymmetric numbering of the mesh nodes used to solve the PDE on the domain.

Standard Tikhonov regularization, though commonly employed in FWI, applies uniform smoothing that often leads to oversmoothing of key geological features, as it fails to account for the underlying structural complexity of the subsurface. To overcome this limitation, we propose an FWI algorithm enhanced by a novel Tikhonov regularization technique involving a parametric regularizer, which is automatically optimized to apply directional space-variant smoothing. Specifically, the parameters defining the regularizer (orientation and anisotropy) are treated as additional unknowns in the objective function, allowing the algorithm to estimate them simultaneously with the model. We introduce an efficient numerical implementation for FWI with the proposed space-variant regularization. Numerical tests on sparse data demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and robustness in reconstructing models with complex structures, significantly improving the inversion results compared to the standard Tikhonov regularization.",NA,NA,0,1

The integrand may exhibit exponential decay, highly oscillatory behavior, or both simultaneously, making standard quadrature rules computationally expensive. Our approach is based on a Clenshaw-Curtis product-integration rule: the smooth part of the integrand is interpolated using a polynomial at Chebyshev nodes, and the resulting integral is computed exactly. We analyze the convergence of the method with respect to both the number of nodes and the parameter $z$. Additionally, we provide a stable and efficient implementation whose computational cost is essentially independent of $z$ and scales linearly with $L$.

This approach employs continuous Lagrange polynomials in space and explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for time discretization. To stabilize the numerical oscillations inherent in the scheme, a new anisotropic nonlinear artificial viscosity method is introduced. Numerical results demonstrate that this method achieves optimal convergence order with respect to both the polynomial space and time integration. The method is validated using classic benchmark problems for the Vlasov-Poisson equations, including Landau damping, two-stream instability, and bump-on-tail instability in a two-dimensional phase space.",NA,NA,0,1

In particular, the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation is reformulated as a non-constant mobility gradient flow in the Energetic Variational Approach. The marker and cell finite difference method is chosen as the spatial discretization, which facilitates the analysis for the fluid part. In the temporal discretization, the mobility function is computed by a second order extrapolation formula for the sake of unique solvability analysis, while a modified Crank-Nicolson approximation is applied to the singular logarithmic nonlinear term. Nonlinear artificial regularization terms are added in the chemical potential part, so that the positivity-preserving property could be theoretically proved. Meanwhile, a second order accurate, semi-implicit approximation is applied to the convective term in the PNP evolutionary equation, and the fluid momentum equation is similarly computed. In addition, an optimal rate convergence analysis is provided, based on the higher order asymptotic expansion for the numerical solution, the rough and refined error estimate techniques. The following combined theoretical properties have been established for the second order accurate numerical method: (i) second order accuracy, (ii) unique solvability and positivity, (iii) total energy stability, and (iv) optimal rate convergence. A few numerical results are displayed to validate the theoretical analysis.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.07449v2,Investigation of the piston effect in supercritical fluids via a reversible--irreversible vector field splitting-based explicit time integration scheme,Donát M. Takács; Tamás Fülöp; Róbert Kovács; Mátyás Szücs,"In the vicinity of the liquid--vapor critical point, supercritical fluids behave strongly compressibly and, in parallel, thermophysical properties have strong state dependence. These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.",NA,NA,0,1

By introducing a total pressure variable, the MPET system can be reformulated into a coupled Stokes-parabolic system. To efficiently solve this system, we propose a split parallel approach. In the first time step, a monolithic solver is used to solve all variables simultaneously. For subsequent time steps, the system is split into a Stokes subproblem and a parabolic subproblem. These subproblems are then solved in parallel using a stabilization technique. This split parallel approach differs from sequential or iterative decoupling, significantly reducing computational time. The algorithm is proven to be unconditionally stable, optimally convergent, and robust across various parameter settings. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments. We also apply this parallel algorithm to simulate fluid-tissue interactions within the physiological environment of the human brain.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.07150v1,Simulating programmable morphing of shape memory polymer beam systems with complex geometry and topology,Giulio Ferri; Enzo Marino,"We propose a novel approach to the analysis of programmable geometrically exact shear deformable beam systems made of shape memory polymers. The proposed method combines the viscoelastic Generalized Maxwell model with the Williams, Landel and Ferry relaxation principle, enabling the reproduction of the shape memory effect of structural systems featuring complex geometry and topology. Very high efficiency is pursued by discretizing the differential problem in space through the isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) method. The method, in addition to the desirable attributes of isogeometric analysis (IGA), such as exactness of the geometric reconstruction of complex shapes and high-order accuracy, circumvents the need for numerical integration since it discretizes the problem in the strong form. Other distinguishing features of the proposed formulation are: i) ${\rm SO}(3)$-consistency for the linearization of the problem and for the time stepping; ii) minimal (finite) rotation parametrization, that means only three rotational unknowns are used; iii) no additional unknowns are needed to account for the rate-dependent material compared to the purely elastic case.

Despite extensive research on the numerical implementation of this method, no studies have yet explored the well-posedness of the integral invariant model itself. To address this gap, a weak solution theory for CSLDG is developed: A precise definition of the weak solution for the integral invariant model is formulated. Utilizing the slice method, which is frequently employed in existence proofs for parabolic equations, the existence of the weak solution is established through the application of the Riesz Representation Theorem and mollifier techniques. The stability of the integral invariant weak solution is subsequently demonstrated by the strategic selection of the test function Psi, leading to the proof of its uniqueness.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2503.06817v1,An automatic approach to develop the fourth-order and L^2-stable lattice Boltzmann model for diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equations,Ying Chen; Zhenhua Chai; Baochang Shi,"This paper discusses how to develop a high-order multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (MRT-LB) model for the general d(>=1)-dimensional diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equation. Such an MRT-LB model considers the transformation matrix constructed in a natural way and the DdQ(2d^2+1) lattice structure. A key step in developing the high-order MRT-LB model is to determine the adjustable relaxation parameters and weight coefficients, which are used to eliminate the truncation errors at certain orders of the MRT-LB model, while ensuring the stability of the MRT-LB model. In this work, we first present a unified MRT-LB model for the diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equation. Then, through the direct Taylor expansion, we analyze the macroscopic modified equations of the MRT-LB model up to fourth-order, and further derive the fourth-order consistent conditions of the MRT-LB model. Additionally, we also construct the fourth-order initialization scheme for the present LB method. After that, the condition which guarantees that the MRT-LB model can satisfy the stability structure is explicitly given, and from a numerical perspective, once the stability structure is satisfied, the MRT-LB model must be L^2 stable. In combination with the fourth-order consistent and L^2 stability conditions, the relaxation parameters and weight coefficients of the MRT-LB model can be automatically given by a simple computer code. Finally, we perform numerical simulations of several benchmark problems, and find that the numerical results can achieve a fourth-order convergence rate, which is in agreement with our theoretical analysis. In particular, for the isotropic diffusion equation, we also make a comparison between the fourth-order MRT-LB models with the DdQ(2d^2+1) and DdQ(2d+1) lattice structures, and the numerical results show that the MRT-LB model with the DdQ(2d^2+1) lattice structure is more general.",NA,NA,0,1

Precisely, drift is Lipschitz continuous while diffusion along with its derivative is Lipschitz continuous.   Further, we explore the significance of evaluating Brownian trajectories at every switching time of the underlying Markov chain in achieving the convergence rate $1.0$ of the proposed scheme.   In this context, possible variants of the scheme, namely modified randomized and reduced randomized schemes, are considered and their convergence rates are shown to be $1/2$.   Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the convergence rates of these schemes along with their corresponding non-randomized versions.   Further, it is illustrated that the half-order non-randomized reduced and modified schemes outperforms the classical Euler scheme.",NA,NA,0,1

These facts not only give constructive uniqueness proofs of the inverse source problems, but also establish the theoretical basis of the proposed sampling methods. Furthermore, we derive the stability estimates for the corresponding discrete indicators using the far field patterns with finitely many observations and frequencies. We have also proposed the indicators with partial far field patterns and proved their validity for providing the derivative information of the unknown sources.

2503.06528v1,Higher Order Reduced Rank Regression,Leia Greenberg; Haim Avron,"Reduced Rank Regression (RRR) is a widely used method for multi-response regression. However, RRR assumes a linear relationship between features and responses. While linear models are useful and often provide a good approximation, many real-world problems involve more complex relationships that cannot be adequately captured by simple linear interactions. One way to model such relationships is via multilinear transformations. This paper introduces Higher Order Reduced Rank Regression (HORRR), an extension of RRR that leverages multi-linear transformations, and as such is capable of capturing nonlinear interactions in multi-response regression. HORRR employs tensor representations for the coefficients and a Tucker decomposition to impose multilinear rank constraints as regularization akin to the rank constraints in RRR. Encoding these constraints as a manifold allows us to use Riemannian optimization to solve this HORRR problems. We theoretically and empirically analyze the use of Riemannian optimization for solving HORRR problems.",NA,NA,0,1

It is therefore not possible in general to identify cones using Lyapunov rank. But suppose we look only among symmetric cones. Are there any that can be uniquely identified (up to isomorphism) by their Lyapunov ranks? We provide a complete answer for irreducible cones and make some progress in the general case.,NA,NA,0,1
2503.05924v1,Satire: Computing Rigorous Bounds for Floating-Point Rounding Error in Mixed-Precision Loop-Free Programs,Tanmay Tirpankar; Arnab Das; Ganesh Gopalakrishnan,"Techniques that rigorously bound the overall rounding error exhibited by a numerical program are of significant interest for communities developing numerical software. However, there are few available tools today that can be used to rigorously bound errors in programs that employ conditional statements (a basic need) as well as mixed-precision arithmetic (a direction of significant future interest) employing global optimization in error analysis. In this paper, we present a new tool that fills this void while also employing an abstraction-guided optimization approach to allow designers to trade error-bound tightness for gains in analysis time -- useful when searching for design alternatives. We first present the basic rigorous analysis framework of Satire and then show how to extend it to incorporate abstractions, conditionals, and mixed-precision arithmetic. We begin by describing Satire's design and its performance on a collection of benchmark examples. We then describe these aspects of Satire: (1) how the error-bound and tool execution time vary with the abstraction level; (2) the additional machinery to handle conditional expression branches, including defining the concepts of instability jumps and instability window widths and measuring these quantities; and (3) how the error changes when a mix of precision values are used. To showcase how \satire can add value during design, we start with a Conjugate Gradient solver and demonstrate how its step size and search direction are affected by different precision settings. Satire is freely available for evaluation, and can be used during the design of numerical routines to effect design tradeoffs guided by rigorous empirical error guarantees.",NA,NA,0,1

We then eliminate the local degrees-of-freedom of this preconditioner to obtain a preconditioner for the reduced system. However, not all reduced preconditioners obtained in this way are automatically robust. We therefore present conditions that must be satisfied for the reduced preconditioner to be robust. To demonstrate our approach, we determine preconditioners for the reduced systems obtained from hybridizable discretizations of the Darcy and Stokes equations.

2503.05892v1,An implicit shock tracking method for simulation of shock-dominated flows over complex domains using mesh-based parametrizations,Alexander M. Perez Reyes; Matthew J. Zahr,"A mesh-based parametrization is a parametrization of a geometric object that is defined solely from a mesh of the object, e.g., without an analytical expression or computer-aided design (CAD) representation of the object. In this work, we propose a mesh-based parametrization of an arbitrary $d'$-dimensional object embedded in a $d$-dimensional space using tools from high-order finite elements. Using mesh-based parametrizations, we construct a boundary-preserving parametrization of the nodal coordinates of a computational mesh that ensures all nodes remain on all their original boundaries. These boundary-preseving parametrizations allow the nodes of the mesh to move only in ways that will not change the computational domain. They also ensure nodes will not move between boundaries, which would cause issues assigning boundary conditions for partial differential equation simulations and lead to inaccurate geometry representations for non-smooth boundary transitions. Finally, we integrate boundary-preserving, mesh-based parametrizations into high-order implicit shock tracking, an optimization-based discontinuous Galerkin method that moves nodes to align mesh faces with non-smooth flow features to represent them perfectly with inter-element jumps, leaving the intra-element polynomial basis to represent smooth regions of the flow with high-order accuracy. Mesh-based parametrizations enable implicit shock tracking simulations of shock-dominated flows over geometries without simple analytical parametrizations. Several demonstrations of mesh-based parametrizations are provided.",NA,NA,0,1

Ham,"The Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation is a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation that governs the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of a tokamak plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions to the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma current density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of whether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with more complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions (commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered. In this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated evolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm. By varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil currents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium solutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We suggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the restrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally couples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the interior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for wider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple solutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their potential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.05672v1,The latent variable proximal point algorithm for variational problems with inequality constraints,Jørgen S. Dokken; Patrick E. Farrell; Brendan Keith; Ioannis P. A. Papadopoulos; Thomas M. Surowiec,"The latent variable proximal point (LVPP) algorithm is a framework for solving infinite-dimensional variational problems with pointwise inequality constraints. The algorithm is a saddle point reformulation of the Bregman proximal point algorithm. At the continuous level, the two formulations are equivalent, but the saddle point formulation is more amenable to discretization because it introduces a structure-preserving transformation between a latent function space and the feasible set. Working in this latent space is much more convenient for enforcing inequality constraints than the feasible set, as discretizations can employ general linear combinations of suitable basis functions, and nonlinear solvers can involve general additive updates. LVPP yields numerical methods with observed mesh-independence for obstacle problems, contact, fracture, plasticity, and others besides; in many cases, for the first time. The framework also extends to more complex constraints, providing means to enforce convexity in the Monge--Amp\`ere equation and handling quasi-variational inequalities, where the underlying constraint depends implicitly on the unknown solution. In this paper, we describe the LVPP algorithm in a general form and apply it to twelve problems from across mathematics.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.05557v1,A sharp-interface discontinuous Galerkin method for simulation of two-phase flow of real gases based on implicit shock tracking,Charles Naudet; Brian Taylor; Matthew J. Zahr,"We present a high-order, sharp-interface method for simulation of two-phase flow of real gases using implicit shock tracking. The method is based on a phase-field formulation of two-phase, compressible, inviscid flow with a trivial mixture model. Implicit shock tracking is a high-order, optimization-based discontinuous Galerkin method that automatically aligns mesh faces with non-smooth flow features to represent them perfectly with inter-element jumps. It is used to accurately approximate shocks and rarefactions without stabilization and converge the phase-field solution to a sharp interface one by aligning mesh faces with the material interface. Time-dependent problems are formulated as steady problems in a space-time domain where complex wave interactions (e.g., intersections and reflections) manifest as space-time triplet points. The space-time formulation avoids complex re-meshing and solution transfer that would be required to track moving waves with mesh faces using the method of lines. The approach is applied to several two-phase flow Riemann problems involving gases with ideal, stiffened gas, and Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson (BKW) equations of state, including a spherically symmetric underwater explosion problem. In all cases, the method aligns element faces with all shocks (including secondary shocks that form at time t > 0), rarefactions, and material interfaces, and accurately resolves the flow field on coarse space-time grids.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.05533v2,Exploiting Inexact Computations in Multilevel Sampling Methods,Josef Martínek; Erin Carson; Robert Scheichl,"Multilevel sampling methods, such as multilevel and multifidelity Monte Carlo, multilevel stochastic collocation, or delayed acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo, have become standard uncertainty quantification tools for a wide class of forward and inverse problems. The underlying idea is to achieve faster convergence by leveraging a hierarchy of models, such as partial differential equation (PDE) or stochastic differential equation (SDE) discretisations with increasing accuracy. By optimally redistributing work among the levels, multilevel methods can achieve significant performance improvement compared to single level methods working with one high-fidelity model. Intuitively, approximate solutions on coarser levels can tolerate large computational error without affecting the overall accuracy. We show how this can be used in high-performance computing applications to obtain a significant performance gain.   As a use case, we analyse the computational error in the standard multilevel Monte Carlo method and formulate an adaptive algorithm which determines a minimum required computational accuracy on each level of discretisation. We show two examples of how the inexactness can be converted into actual gains using an elliptic PDE with lognormal random coefficients. Using a low precision sparse direct solver combined with iterative refinement results in a simulated gain in memory references of up to $3.5\times$ compared to the reference double precision solver; while using a MINRES iterative solver, a practical speedup of up to $1.5\times$ in terms of FLOPs is achieved.

This work introduces a novel flexibility analysis method that requires only that model constraints (e.g., defining product Critical Quality Attributes or process Key Performance Indicators) be explicitly provided or approximated by a closed-form function, such as a multivariate polynomial model. The method is based on V.L. Rvachev's R-functions, enabling an explicit analytical representation of the feasibility region without relying on complex optimization-based approaches. R-functions offer a framework for describing intricate geometric shapes and performing operations on them using implicit functions and inequality constraints. The theory of R-functions facilitates the identification of feasibility regions through algebraic manipulation, making it a more practical alternative to traditional optimization-based methods.

2503.05419v1,Physics-based machine learning for fatigue lifetime prediction under non-uniform loading scenarios,Abedulgader Baktheer; Fadi Aldakheel,"Accurate lifetime prediction of structures subjected to cyclic loading is vital, especially in scenarios involving non-uniform loading histories where load sequencing critically influences structural durability. Addressing this complexity requires advanced modeling approaches capable of capturing the intricate relationship between loading sequences and fatigue lifetime. Traditional fatigue simulations are computationally prohibitive, necessitating more efficient methods. This study highlights the potential of physics-based machine learning ($\phi$ML) to predict the fatigue lifetime of materials. Specifically, a FFNN is designed to embed physical constraints from experimental evidence directly into its architecture to enhance prediction accuracy. It is trained using numerical simulations generated by a physically based anisotropic continuum damage fatigue model. The model is calibrated and validated against experimental fatigue data of concrete cylinder specimens tested in uniaxial compression. The proposed approach demonstrates superior accuracy compared to purely data-driven neural networks, particularly in situations with limited training data, achieving realistic predictions of damage accumulation. Thus, a general algorithm is developed and successfully applied to predict fatigue lifetimes under complex loading scenarios with multiple loading ranges. Hereby, the $\phi$ML model serves as a surrogate to capture damage evolution across load transitions. The $\phi$ML based algorithm is subsequently employed to investigate the influence of multiple loading transitions on accumulated fatigue life, and its predictions align with trends observed in recent experimental studies. This work demonstrates $\phi$ML as a promising technique for efficient and reliable fatigue life prediction in engineering structures, with possible integration into digital twin models for real-time assessment.",NA,NA,0,1

We extend the construction-free median QMC rule to the unanchored weighted Sobolev space of functions defined over $\mathbb{R}^s$. By taking the median of $k=\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ independent randomized QMC estimators, we prove that for any $\epsilon\in(0,r-\frac{1}{2}]$, our method achieves a mean absolute error bound of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-r+\epsilon})$, where $N$ is the number of points and $r>\frac{1}{2}$ is a parameter determined by the function space.

2503.05282v1,Local time-integration for Friedrichs' systems,Marlis Hochbruck; Malik Scheifinger,"In this paper, we address the full discretization of Friedrichs' systems with a two-field structure, such as Maxwell's equations or the acoustic wave equation in div-grad form, cf. [14]. We focus on a discontinuous Galerkin space discretization applied to a locally refined mesh or a small region with high wave speed. This results in a stiff system of ordinary differential equations, where the stiffness is mainly caused by a small region of the spatial mesh. When using explicit time-integration schemes, the time step size is severely restricted by a few spatial elements, leading to a loss of efficiency. As a remedy, we propose and analyze a general leapfrog-based scheme which is motivated by [5]. The new, fully explicit, local time-integration method filters the stiff part of the system in such a way that its CFL condition is significantly weaker than that of the leapfrog scheme while its computational cost is only slightly larger. For this scheme, the filter function is a suitably scaled and shifted Chebyshev polynomial. While our main interest is in explicit local-time stepping schemes, the filter functions can be much more general, for instance, a certain rational function leads to the locally implicit method, proposed and analyzed in [24]. Our analysis provides sufficient conditions on the filter function to ensure full order of convergence in space and second order in time for the whole class of local time-integration schemes.",NA,NA,0,1

Such equations are numerically challenging as they require large-scale computations and the usage of parallel hardware. Domain decomposition is a common choice of numerical method for stationary domains, as it gives rise to parallel discretizations. In this study, we introduce a variational framework that extends the use of such methods to evolving domains. In particular, we prove that transmission problems on evolving domains are well posed and equivalent to the corresponding parabolic problems. This in turn implies that the standard non-overlapping domain decompositions, including the Robin-Robin method, become well defined approximations. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the Robin--Robin method.

We proposed a holistic approach that integrates lines of various operator companies as well as external geographical features of the railway system. The optimized evacuation model was mathematically derived based on matrix computation using nonlinear programming. The model also takes into account the capacity of the surrounding evacuation stations, as well as the travel cost. Moreover, our model can flexibly simulate disruptions at multiple stations or any number of stations and lines, enhancing its applicability. We collected the large-scale railway network of the Greater Tokyo area for experimentation and evaluation. We simulated evacuation plans for several major stations, including Tokyo, Shinjuku, and Shibuya. The results indicate that the evacuation passenger flow (EPF) and the average travel time (ATT) during emergencies were optimized, staying within both the capacity limits of the targeted neighboring stations and the disruption recovery time.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.05017v1,Projective integration schemes for nonlinear degenerate parabolic systems,Tommaso Tenna,"A general high-order fully explicit scheme based on projective integration methods is here presented to solve systems of degenerate parabolic equations in general dimensions. The method is based on a BGK approximation of the advection-diffusion equation, where we introduce projective integration method as time integrator to deal with the stiff relaxation term. This approach exploits the clear gap in the eigenvalues spectrum of the kinetic equation, taking into account a sequence of small time steps to damp out the stiff components, followed by an extrapolation step over a large time interval. The time step restriction on the projective step is similar to the CFL condition for advection-diffusion equations. In this paper we discuss the stability and the consistency of the method, presenting some numerical simulations in one and two spatial dimensions.",NA,NA,0,1

On the geometric side, it yields algebraic operations to approximate Lagrangian bisections of $\mathcal{G}$ using the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and, in turn, aims at a better understanding of the group of Poisson diffeomorphisms of $M.$ On the computational side, we define a new class of Poisson integrators for Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.04932v1,A Reduced Augmentation Implicit Low-rank (RAIL) integrator for solving three-dimensional diffusion and advection-diffusion equations in the Tucker tensor format,Joseph Nakao; Gianluca Ceruti; Lukas Einkemmer,"This paper presents a rank-adaptive implicit integrator for the tensor solution of three-dimensional diffusion and advection-diffusion equations. In particular, the recently developed Reduced Augmentation Implicit Low-rank (RAIL) integrator is extended from two-dimensional matrix solutions to three-dimensional tensor solutions stored in a Tucker tensor decomposition. Spectral methods are considered for spatial discretizations, and diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (RK) and implicit-explicit (IMEX) RK methods are used for time discretization. The RAIL integrator first discretizes the partial differential equation fully in space and time. Then at each RK stage, the bases computed at the previous stages are augmented and reduced to predict the current (future) basis and construct projection subspaces. After updating the bases in a dimension-by-dimension manner, a Galerkin projection is performed by projecting onto the span of the previous bases and the newly updated bases. A truncation procedure according to a specified tolerance follows. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the integrator using implicit and implicit-explicit time discretizations, as well as how well the integrator captures the rank of the solutions.",NA,NA,0,1

2503.04695v1,A linearly-implicit energy preserving scheme for geometrically nonlinear mechanics based on non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations,Andrea Brugnoli; Denis Matignon; Joseph Morlier,"This work presents a novel formulation and numerical strategy for the simulation of geometrically nonlinear structures. First, a non-canonical Hamiltonian (Poisson) formulation is introduced by including the dynamics of the stress tensor. This framework is developed for von-K\'arm\'an nonlinearities in beams and plates, as well as finite strain elasticity with Saint-Venant material behavior. In the case of plates, both negligible and non-negligible membrane inertia are considered. For the former case the two-dimensional elasticity complex is leveraged to express the dynamics in terms of the Airy stress function. The finite element discretization employs a mixed approach, combining a conforming approximation for displacement and velocity fields with a discontinuous stress tensor representation. A staggered, linear implicit time integration scheme is proposed, establishing connections with existing explicit-implicit energy-preserving methods. The stress degrees of freedom are statically condensed, reducing the computational complexity to solving a system with a positive definite matrix. The methodology is validated through numerical experiments on the Duffing oscillator, a von-K\'arm\'an beam, and a column undergoing finite strain elasticity. Comparisons with fully implicit energy-preserving method and the explicit Newmark scheme demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy while maintaining energy stability. Additionally, it enables larger time steps compared to explicit schemes and exhibits computational efficiency comparable to the leapfrog method.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.04684v1,Propagating Model Uncertainty through Filtering-based Probabilistic Numerical ODE Solvers,Dingling Yao; Filip Tronarp; Nathanael Bosch,"Filtering-based probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), also known as ODE filters, have been established as efficient methods for quantifying numerical uncertainty in the solution of ODEs. In practical applications, however, the underlying dynamical system often contains uncertain parameters, requiring the propagation of this model uncertainty to the ODE solution. In this paper, we demonstrate that ODE filters, despite their probabilistic nature, do not automatically solve this uncertainty propagation problem. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that combines ODE filters with numerical quadrature to properly marginalize over uncertain parameters, while accounting for both parameter uncertainty and numerical solver uncertainty. Experiments across multiple dynamical systems demonstrate that the resulting uncertainty estimates closely match reference solutions. Notably, we show how the numerical uncertainty from the ODE solver can help prevent overconfidence in the propagated uncertainty estimates, especially when using larger step sizes. Our results illustrate that probabilistic numerical methods can effectively quantify both numerical and parametric uncertainty in dynamical systems.",NA,NA,0,1

We construct two classes of the ERKC methods and analyze their convergence properties. It is shown that methods with $s$ arbitrary nonconfluent collocation parameters achieve convergence of order $s$. Provided that the collocation parameters fulfill some additional conditions and the solutions of the problems exhibit sufficient temporal and spatial smoothness, we derive superconvergence results of order $s + 1$ and $s+1+\beta$.

These can be used within data processing pipelines for machine learning tasks and numerical methods. We show how our GNPs can be trained to learn robust latent representations for the differential geometry of point-clouds to provide estimates of metric, curvature, and other shape-related features. We demonstrate how our pre-trained GNPs can be used (i) to estimate the geometric properties of surfaces of arbitrary shape and topologies with robustness in the presence of noise, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to solve equations for shape deformations such as curvature driven flows. We also release a package of the codes and weights for using our pre-trained GNPs for processing point cloud representations. This allows for incorporating our pre-trained GNPs as components for reuse within existing and new data processing pipelines. The GNPs also can be used as part of numerical solvers involving geometry or as part of methods for performing inference and other geometric tasks.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.04628v1,A Method for Establishing Asymptotically Accurate Bounds for Extremal Roots of Eulerian Polynomials Using Polynomial Stability Preservers,Alejandro González Nevado,"We develop the tools to bound extreme roots of multivariate real zero polynomials globally. This is done through the use of a relaxation that approximates their rigidly convex sets. This relaxation can easily be constructed using the degree $3$ truncation of the polynomial and it produces in this way a spectrahedron whose computation is relatively easy and whose size is relatively small and depending solely on the number of variables of the polynomial. As we know that, in order to be able to produce in general spectrahedral representations of rigidly convex sets it is necessary to build matrices of very big size, we try, analyze and experiment with several constructions that could increase the size of these matrices. These constructions are based principally in two main approaches: adding information about higher degree monomials or non-trivially increasing the number of variables of the original polynomial. We explore these two construction first in a general setting and see that it is necessary to particularize to certain families of polynomials in order to make them work. In particular, we are able to prove that increasing the number of variables improves the behavior of the relaxation along the diagonal in the case of Eulerian polynomials. We see that applying the relaxation to multivariate Eulerian polynomials and then looking at the univariate polynomials injected in their diagonals produces an exponential asymptotic improvement in the bounds provided. We compare these bounds with other bounds that have appeared previously in the literature and refine these previous bounds in order to study how close do the bounds provided by the relaxation are to the actual roots of the univariate Eulerian polynomials.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.04523v1,First-order methods on bounded-rank tensors converging to stationary points,Bin Gao; Renfeng Peng; Ya-xiang Yuan,"Provably finding stationary points on bounded-rank tensors turns out to be an open problem [E. Levin, J. Kileel, and N. Boumal, Math. Program., 199 (2023), pp. 831--864] due to the inherent non-smoothness of the set of bounded-rank tensors. We resolve this problem by proposing two first-order methods with guaranteed convergence to stationary points. Specifically, we revisit the variational geometry of bounded-rank tensors and explicitly characterize its normal cones. Moreover, we propose gradient-related approximate projection methods that are provable to find stationary points, where the decisive ingredients are gradient-related vectors from tangent cones, line search along approximate projections, and rank-decreasing mechanisms near rank-deficient points. Numerical experiments on tensor completion validate that the proposed methods converge to stationary points across various rank parameters.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.04493v1,Treatment of Wall Boundary Conditions in High-Order Compact Gas-Kinetic Schemes,Jiawang Zhang; Xing Ji; Kun Xu,"The boundary layer represents a fundamental structure in fluid dynamics, where accurate boundary discretization significantly enhances computational efficiency. This paper presents a third-order boundary discretization for compact gas-kinetic scheme (GKS). Wide stencils and curved boundaries pose challenges in the boundary treatment for high-order schemes, particularly for temporal accuracy. By utilizing a time-dependent gas distribution function, the GKS simultaneously evaluates fluxes and updates flow variables at cell interfaces, enabling the concurrent update of cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients within the third-order compact scheme. The proposed one-sided discretization achieves third-order spatial accuracy on boundary cells by utilizing updated flow variables and gradients in the discretization for non-slip wall boundary conditions. High-order temporal accuracy on boundary cells is achieved through the GKS time-dependent flux implementation with multi-stage multi-derivative methodology. Additionally, we develop exact no-penetration conditions for both adiabatic and isothermal wall boundaries, with extensions to curved mesh geometries to fully exploit the advantages of high-order schemes. Comparative analysis between the proposed one-sided third-order boundary scheme, third-order boundary scheme with ghost cells, and second-order boundary scheme demonstrates significant performance differences for the third-order compact GKS. Results indicate that lower-order boundary cell treatments yield substantially inferior results, while the proposed third-order treatment demonstrates superior performance, particularly on coarse grid configurations.",NA,NA,0,1

These models are particularly useful in early design stages or for the development of small UAVs (maximum take-off mass below 7 kg). This study evaluates two frequency-domain system identification methods, Fast Relaxed Vector Fitting (FRVF) and the Loewner Framework (LF), for predicting the flutter onset speed of a flexible wing model. Both methods are applied to extract modal parameters from Ground Vibration Testing data, which are subsequently used to develop a reduced-order model with two degrees of freedom. Results indicate that FRVF and LFinformed models provide reliable flutter speed, with predictions deviating by no more than 3% (FRVF) and 5% (LF) from the N4SID-informed benchmark. The findings highlight the sensitivity of flutter speed predictions to damping ratio identification accuracy and demonstrate the potential of these methods as computationally efficient alternatives for preliminary aeroelastic assessments.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.04427v1,Near instance optimality of the Lanczos method for Stieltjes and related matrix functions,Marcel Schweitzer,"Polynomial Krylov subspace methods are among the most widely used methods for approximating $f(A)b$, the action of a matrix function on a vector, in particular when $A$ is large and sparse. When $A$ is Hermitian positive definite, the Lanczos method is the standard choice of Krylov method, and despite being very simplistic in nature, it often outperforms other, more sophisticated methods. In fact, one often observes that the error of the Lanczos method behaves almost exactly as the error of the best possible approximation from the Krylov space (which is in general not efficiently computable). However, theoretical guarantees for the deviation of the Lanczos error from the optimal error are mostly lacking so far (except for linear systems and a few other special cases). We prove a rigorous bound for this deviation when $f$ belongs to the important class of Stieltjes functions (which, e.g., includes inverse fractional powers as special cases) and a related class (which contains, e.g., the square root and the shifted logarithm), thus providing a \emph{near instance optimality} guarantee. While the constants in our bounds are likely not optimal, they greatly improve over the few results that are available in the literature and resemble the actual behavior much better.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.04424v1,Determinant Estimation under Memory Constraints and Neural Scaling Laws,Siavash Ameli; Chris van der Heide; Liam Hodgkinson; Fred Roosta; Michael W. Mahoney,"Calculating or accurately estimating log-determinants of large positive semi-definite matrices is of fundamental importance in many machine learning tasks. While its cubic computational complexity can already be prohibitive, in modern applications, even storing the matrices themselves can pose a memory bottleneck. To address this, we derive a novel hierarchical algorithm based on block-wise computation of the LDL decomposition for large-scale log-determinant calculation in memory-constrained settings. In extreme cases where matrices are highly ill-conditioned, accurately computing the full matrix itself may be infeasible. This is particularly relevant when considering kernel matrices at scale, including the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) of neural networks trained on large datasets. Under the assumption of neural scaling laws in the test error, we show that the ratio of pseudo-determinants satisfies a power-law relationship, allowing us to derive corresponding scaling laws. This enables accurate estimation of NTK log-determinants from a tiny fraction of the full dataset; in our experiments, this results in a $\sim$100,000$\times$ speedup with improved accuracy over competing approximations. Using these techniques, we successfully estimate log-determinants for dense matrices of extreme sizes, which were previously deemed intractable and inaccessible due to their enormous scale and computational demands.",NA,NA,0,1

2503.04092v1,Parameter estimation in fluid flow models from undersampled frequency space data,Miriam Löcke; Pim van Ooij; Cristóbal Bertoglio,"4D Flow MRI is the state of the art technique for measuring blood flow, and it provides valuable information for inverse problems in the cardiovascular system. However, 4D Flow MRI has a very long acquisition time, straining healthcare resources and inconveniencing patients. Due to this, usually only a part of the frequency space is acquired, where then further assumptions need to be made in order to obtain an image.   Inverse problems from 4D Flow MRI data have the potential to compute clinically relevant quantities without the need for invasive procedures, and/or expanding the set of biomarkers for a more accurate diagnosis. However, reconstructing MRI measurements with Compressed Sensing techniques introduces artifacts and inaccuracies, which can compromise the results of the inverse problems. Additionally, there is a high number of different sampling patterns available, and it is often unclear which of them is preferable.   Here, we present a parameter estimation problem directly using highly undersampled frequency space measurements. This problem is numerically solved by a Reduced-Order Unscented Kalman Filter (ROUKF). We show that this results in more accurate parameter estimation for boundary conditions in a synthetic aortic blood flow than using measurements reconstructed with Compressed Sensing.   We also compare different sampling patterns, demonstrating how the quality of the parameter estimation depends on the choice of the sampling pattern. The results show a considerably higher accuracy than an inverse problem using velocity measurements reconstructed via compressed sensing. Finally, we confirm these findings on real MRI data from a mechanical phantom.",NA,NA,0,1

For the optimal recovery of the surfaces, the selection of free parameters in related PDE models are further studied and analyzed. Besides, several criteria like distance are employed in above methods instead of the classical parameter lambda determination strategy, which leads to a more reliable reconstruction performance. Finally, the volume estimation of 3D irregular objects is proposed based on the optimal reconstructed geometric models via proposed meshless methods.

The resulting JBD method for computing extreme generalized singular values and corresponding left and right singular vectors of $\{A,L\}$ realizes the standard Rayleigh--Ritz projection of the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) problem of $\{A,L\}$ onto the two left and one right subspaces generated by the JBD process. In this paper, the implicit restarting technique is nontrivially and skillfully extended to the JBD process, and an implicitly restarted JBD (IRJBD) algorithm is developed with proper selection of crucial shifts proposed and a few key implementation details addressed in finite precision arithmetic. Compact upper bounds are established for the residual norm of an approximate GSVD component in both exact and finite precision arithmetic, which are used to design efficient and reliable stopping criteria and avoid the expensive computation of approximate right generalized singular vectors.

Our work introduces a new two-level solver for HPS which divides the method into dense linear algebra operations that can be implemented on GPUs, and a sparse system encoding the hierarchical aspects of the method which interfaces with highly optimized multilevel sparse solvers. This methodology improves the numerical stability of HPS as well as its computational performance.

Oberai; Thomas J. R. Hughes; Mats G. Larson,"The optimal Petrov-Galerkin formulation to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) recovers the best approximation in a specified finite-dimensional (trial) space with respect to a suitable norm. However, the recovery of this optimal solution is contingent on being able to construct the optimal weighting functions associated with the trial basis. While explicit constructions are available for simple one- and two-dimensional problems, such constructions for a general multidimensional problem remain elusive. In the present work, we revisit the optimal Petrov-Galerkin formulation through the lens of deep learning. We propose an operator network framework called Petrov-Galerkin Variationally Mimetic Operator Network (PG-VarMiON), which emulates the optimal Petrov-Galerkin weak form of the underlying PDE. The PG-VarMiON is trained in a supervised manner using a labeled dataset comprising the PDE data and the corresponding PDE solution, with the training loss depending on the choice of the optimal norm. The special architecture of the PG-VarMiON allows it to implicitly learn the optimal weighting functions, thus endowing the proposed operator network with the ability to generalize well beyond the training set. We derive approximation error estimates for PG-VarMiON, highlighting the contributions of various error sources, particularly the error in learning the true weighting functions. Several numerical results are presented for the advection-diffusion equation to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. By embedding the Petrov-Galerkin structure into the network architecture, PG-VarMiON exhibits greater robustness and improved generalization compared to other popular deep operator frameworks, particularly when the training data is limited.",NA,NA,0,1

In particular, lrAA carries out all linear and nonlinear operations in low-rank form with rank truncation using an adaptive truncation tolerance. We propose a simple scheduling strategy to update the truncation tolerance throughout the iteration according to a residual indicator. This controls the intermediate rank and iteration number effectively. To perform rank truncation for nonlinear functions, we propose a new cross approximation, which we call Cross-DEIM, with adaptive error control that is based on the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Cross-DEIM employs an iterative update between the approximate singular value decomposition (SVD) and cross approximation. It naturally incorporates a warm-start strategy for each lrAA iterate. We demonstrate the superior performance of lrAA applied to a range of linear and nonlinear problems, including those arising from finite difference discretizations of Laplace's equation, the Bratu problem, the elliptic Monge-Amp\'ere equation and the Allen-Cahn equation.",NA,NA,0,1

2503.03847v1,Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding,L. Liu; F. Liu; D. Zenkert; M. Åkermo; M. Fagerström,"Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behavior confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after foam yielding. Following the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling stress and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructural features of close-cell foams.",NA,NA,0,1

Higham; Xiaobo Liu,"We consider the solution of the general Sylvester equation $AX+XB=C$ in mixed precision. First, we investigate the use of GMRES-based iterative refinement (GMRES-IR) to solve the equation using implicitly its Kronecker product form: we propose an efficient scheme to use the Schur factors of the coefficient matrices as preconditioners, but we demonstrate that this approach is not suitable in the case of the Sylvester equation. By revisiting a stationary iteration for linear systems, we therefore derive a new iterative refinement scheme for the quasi-triangular Sylvester equation, and our rounding error analysis provides sufficient conditions for convergence and a bound on the attainable relative residual. We leverage this iterative scheme to solve the general Sylvester equation in mixed precision. The new algorithms compute the Schur decomposition of the matrix coefficients in low precision, use the low-precision Schur factors to obtain an approximate solution to the quasi-triangular equation, and iteratively refine it to obtain a working-precision solution to the quasi-triangular equation. However, being only orthonormal to low precision, the unitary Schur factors of $A$ and $B$ cannot be used to recover the solution to the original equation. We propose two effective approaches to address this issue: one is based on re-orthonormalization in the working precision, and the other on explicit inversion of the almost-unitary factors. We test these mixed-precision algorithms on various Sylvester and Lyapunov equations from the literature. Our numerical experiments show that, for both classes of equations, the new algorithms are at least as accurate as existing ones. Our cost analysis, on the other hand, suggests that they would typically be faster than mono-precision alternatives if implemented on hardware that natively supports low precision.",NA,NA,0,1

It is shown that the schemes for the Schwarz equation and the second-order ODE (with an arbitrary constant $C$) can be related through a B\""acklund-type difference transformation. In addition, previously unexamined aspects of the difference scheme for the second-order ODE are discussed, including its singular solution and the complete set of difference first integrals for the case $C^2=4$.",NA,NA,0,1

In this study, we propose a framework for investigating the internal inference impacted by input data augmentations. The internal changes in network operation are reflected in activation changes measured by variance, which can be decomposed into components related to each augmentation, employing Sobol indices and Shapley values. These quantities enable one to visualize sensitivity to different variables and use them for guided masking of activations. In addition, we introduce a way of single-class sensitivity analysis where the candidates are filtered according to their matching to prediction bias generated by targeted damaging of the activations. Relying on the observed parallels, we assume that the developed framework can potentially be transferred to studying biological neural networks in complex environments.",NA,NA,0,1

2503.03109v1,A parallel-in-time method based on the Parareal algorithm and High-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition with applications to fluid simulations,Weifan Liu,"The high cost of sequential time integration is one major constraint that limits the speedup of a time-parallel algorithm like the Parareal algorithm due to the difficulty of coarsening time steps in a stiff numerical problem. To address this challenge, we develop a parallel-in-time approach based on the Parareal algorithm, in which we construct a novel coarse solver using a data-driven method based on Dynamic Mode Decomposition in place of a classic time marching scheme. The proposed solver computes an approximation of the solution using two numerical schemes of different accuracies in parallel, and apply High-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to reduce the cost of sequential computations. Compared to the original Parareal algorithm, the proposed approach allows for the construction of low-cost coarse solvers for many complicated stiff problems. We demonstrate through several numerical examples in fluid dynamics that the proposed method can effectively reduce the serial computation cost and improve the parallel speedup of long-time simulations which are hard to accelerate using the original Parareal algorithm.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.03069v1,Convergence of Ray- and Pixel-Driven Discretization Frameworks in the Strong Operator Topology,Richard Huber,"Tomography is a central tool in medical applications, allowing doctors to investigate patients' interior features. The Radon transform is commonly used to model the corresponding measurement process. Since in any practical application one can only obtain and process finitely many measurements, suitable discretization of the Radon transform and its adjoint (called the backprojection) is crucial. The most commonly used discretization approach combines the ray-driven Radon transform with the pixel-driven backprojection, as anecdotal reports describe these as showing the best approximation performance. However, there is little rigorous understanding of induced approximation errors. These methods involve three discretization parameters: the spatial-, detector-, and angular resolutions. Most commonly, balanced resolutions are used, i.e., the same (or similar) spatial- and detector resolutions. We present a novel interpretation of ray- and pixel-driven discretizations as `convolutional methods'. This allows for a structured analysis that can explain observed behavior. In particular, we prove convergence in the strong operator topology of the ray-driven Radon transform and the pixel-driven backprojection under suitable choice of discretization parameters. Notably, said suitable parameter choices include the combination of the ray-driven Radon transform with the pixel-driven backprojection under balanced resolutions, thus theoretically justifying this approach. Our theoretical investigations are complemented by numerical experiments that show behavior in simulations that the theory predicted or suggested.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.03019v1,Stability and Time-Step Constraints of Exponential Time Differencing Runge--Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Advection-Diffusion Equations,Ziyao Xu; Zheng Sun; Yong-Tao Zhang,"In this paper, we investigate the stability and time-step constraints for solving advection-diffusion equations using exponential time differencing (ETD) Runge-Kutta (RK) methods in time and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods in space. We demonstrate that the resulting fully discrete scheme is stable when the time-step size is upper bounded by a constant. More specifically, when central fluxes are used for the advection term, the schemes are stable under the time-step constraint tau <= tau_0 * d / a^2, while when upwind fluxes are used, the schemes are stable if tau <= max{tau_0 * d / a^2, c_0 * h / a}. Here, tau is the time-step size, h is the spatial mesh size, and a and d are constants for the advection and diffusion coefficients, respectively. The constant c_0 is the CFL constant for the explicit RK method for the purely advection equation, and tau_0 is a constant that depends on the order of the ETD-RK method. These stability conditions are consistent with those of the implicit-explicit RKDG method. The time-step constraints are rigorously proved for the lowest-order case and are validated through Fourier analysis for higher-order cases. Notably, the constant tau_0 in the fully discrete ETD-RKDG schemes appears to be determined by the stability condition of their semi-discrete (continuous in space, discrete in time) ETD-RK counterparts and is insensitive to the polynomial degree and the specific choice of the DG method. Numerical examples, including problems with nonlinear convection in one and two dimensions, are provided to validate our findings.",NA,NA,0,1

General boundary conditions are enforced by introducing an adsorption/depletion layer at the boundary wherein particles are added or removed as dictated by the boundary conditions.

It turns out to be a ""18-cycle'', i.e. involving a heteroclinic chain of 18 different base points at the Kasner circle. We then show that the combined cinear local passage at the 18-cycle is a contraction. This qualifies the 18-cycle as a candidate for proving the first rigorous convergence theorem in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$.   For the numerical simulation of solutions that follow such heteroclinic cycles, we use a variable-step, variable-order (VSVO) Adams-Bashforth-Moulton PECE solver in Matlab.

The BCs reproduce the visco-elastic structural support provided by the soft tissue and the spine and allow for the inclusion of the heart motion effect.   Methods: we first segment the TA from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography and derive the heart motion by tracking the aortic annulus from cine-MRI. A rigid-wall fluid-dynamic simulation is performed to derive the time-varying wall pressure field. We build the finite element model considering patient-specific material properties and imposing the derived pressure field and the motion at the annulus boundary. The calibration, which involves the zero-pressure state computation, is based on purely structural simulations. After obtaining the vessel boundaries from the cine-MRI sequences, an iterative procedure is performed to minimize the distance between them and the corresponding boundaries derived from the deformed structural model. A strongly-coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis is finally performed with the tuned parameters and compared to the purely structural simulation.   Results and Conclusion: the calibration with structural simulations allows to reduce maximum and mean distances between image-derived and simulation-derived boundaries from 8.64 mm to 6.37 mm and from 2.24 mm to 1.83 mm, respectively. The maximum root mean square error between the deformed structural and FSI surface meshes is 0.19 mm.

In this study, we evaluate and compare the ability of local and global shape features to predict ascending aortic aneurysm growth.   Material and methods: 70 patients with aneurysm, for which two 3D acquisitions were available, are included. Following segmentation, three local shape features are computed: (1) the ratio between maximum diameter and length of the ascending aorta centerline, (2) the ratio between the length of external and internal lines on the ascending aorta and (3) the tortuosity of the ascending tract. By exploiting longitudinal data, the aneurysm growth rate is derived. Using radial basis function mesh morphing, iso-topological surface meshes are created. Statistical shape analysis is performed through unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares (PLS). Two types of global shape features are identified: three PCA-derived and three PLS-based shape modes. Three regression models are set for growth prediction: two based on gaussian support vector machine using local and PCA-derived global shape features; the third is a PLS linear regression model based on the related global shape features. The prediction results are assessed and the aortic shapes most prone to growth are identified.   Results: the prediction root mean square error from leave-one-out cross-validation is: 0.112 mm/month, 0.083 mm/month and 0.066 mm/month for local, PCA-based and PLS-derived shape features, respectively.

In the most widely-studied case, when $q$ is positive, the solutions of equations of this type oscillate at a frequency that increases linearly with $\omega$ and standard ODE solvers require $\mathcal{O}\left(\omega\right)$ time to calculate them. It is well known, though, that phase function methods can be used to solve such equations numerically in time independent of $\omega$. Unfortunately, the running time of these methods increases with $\omega$ when they are applied in the commonly-occurring case in when $q$ has zeros in the solution domain (i.e., when the differential equation has turning points). Here, we introduce a generalized phase function method adapted to equations with simple turning points. More explicitly, we show the existence of slowly-varying ``Airy phase functions'' which represent the solutions of such equations at a cost which is independent of $\omega$ and describe a numerical method for calculating these Airy phase functions in time independent of $\omega$. Using our method, initial or boundary value problems for a large class of second order linear ordinary differential equations with turning points whose coefficients depend on a parameter $\omega$ can be solved in time independent of $\omega$. We also give the results of numerical experiments conducted to demonstrate the properties of our method, including one in which we used our algorithm to rapidly calculate associated Legendre functions of a wide range of orders and degrees.",NA,NA,0,1

This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.",NA,NA,0,1

While many techniques have been proposed over the years to solve the problem, very few consider the accurate reconstruction of the discontinuities themselves.   In this work we develop an algebraic reconstruction technique for two-dimensional functions consisting of two continuity pieces with a smooth discontinuity curve. By extending our earlier one-dimensional method, we show that both the discontinuity curve and the function itself can be reconstructed with high accuracy from a finite number of Fourier measurements.

New error bounds of the fractional order $\mathcal{O}(h^{4(\lambda-1)/5})$ are proved in the mesh energy norm in terms of data, for two initial functions from the Sobolev and Nikolskii spaces with the smoothness order $\lambda$ and $\lambda-1$ and the free term with a dominated mixed smoothness of order $\lambda-1$, for $1\leq\lambda\leq 6$. The corresponding lower error bounds are proved as well to ensure the sharpness in order of the above error bounds with respect to each of the initial functions and the free term for any $\lambda$. Moreover, they demonstrate that the upper error bounds cannot be improved if the Lebesgue summability indices in the error norm are weakened down to 1 both in $x$ and $t$ and simultaneously the summability indices in the norms of data are strengthened up to $\infty$ both in $x$ and $t$.

One of the major shortcomings of NODEs, especially when coupled with explicit integrators, is its long-term stability, which impedes their efficiency and robustness when encountering stiff problems. In this work we present a structure-preserving NODE approach, which integrates with a linear and nonlinear split and an exponential integrator, latter of which is an explicit integrator with stability properties comparable to implicit methods. We demonstrate that our model has advantages in both learning and deployment over standard explicit or even implicit NODE methods. The long-time stability is further enhanced by the Hurwitz matrix decomposition that constrains the spectrum of the linear operator, therefore stabilizing the linearized dynamics. When combined with a Lipschitz-controlled neural network treatment for the nonlinear operator, we show the nonlinear dynamics of the NODE are provably stable in the sense of Lyapunov. For high-dimensional data, we further rely on an autoencoder performing dimension reduction and Higham's algorithm for the matrix-free application of the matrix exponential on a vector.

We propose and establish the convergence of a family of explicit numerical schemes for time discretization adapted to infinite dimension. These schemes correspond to quantum channels and thus preserve the physical properties of quantum evolutions on the set of density operators: linearity, complete positivity and trace.

It allows to avoid the expenses of the rank-structured approximation of function-related tensors defined on large spacial grids, while benefiting from the Tucker decomposition of the rather small core tensor of Chebyshev coefficients. This leads to nearly optimal Tucker rank parameters which are close to the results for well established Tucker-ALS algorithm applied to the large grid-based tensors. These rank parameters inherited from the Tucker-ALS decomposition of the coefficient tensor can be much less than the polynomial degrees of the initial Chebyshev interpolant via function independent basis set. Furthermore, the tensor product Chebyshev polynomials discretized on a tensor grid leads to a low-rank two-level orthogonal algebraic Tucker tensor that approximates the initial function with controllable accuracy. It is shown that our techniques could be gainfully applied to the long-range part of the electrostatic potential of multi-particle systems approximated in the range-separated tensor format.

EvoKAN builds on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), where activation functions are spline based and trainable on each edge, offering localized flexibility across multiple scales. Rather than retraining the network repeatedly, EvoKAN encodes only the PDE's initial state during an initial learning phase. The network parameters then evolve numerically, governed by the same PDE, without any additional optimization. By treating these parameters as continuous functions in the relevant coordinates and updating them through time steps, EvoKAN can predict system trajectories over arbitrarily long horizons, a notable challenge for many conventional neural-network based methods. In addition, EvoKAN integrates the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method to guarantee unconditional energy stability and computational efficiency. At individual time step, SAV only needs to solve decoupled linear systems with constant coefficients, the implementation is significantly simplified. We test the proposed framework in several complex PDEs, including one dimensional and two dimensional Allen-Cahn equations and two dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical results show that EvoKAN solutions closely match analytical references and established numerical benchmarks, effectively capturing both phase-field phenomena (Allen-Cahn) and turbulent flows (Navier-Stokes).",NA,NA,0,1

We develop two neural network algorithms--Born-CNN (BCNN) and CNN-Born (CNNB)--to correct the Born approximation when the scattering is not weak. BCNN applies a post-correction to the Born reconstruction, while CNNB pre-corrects the data. Both methods leverage the Born approximation's excellent fidelity in weak scattering, while extending its applicability beyond its theoretical limits. CNNB particularly exhibits a strong generalization to noisy and absorbing scatterers.

2503.01426v1,A novel multipoint stress control volume method for linear elasticity on quadrilateral grids,Shubin Fu; Lina Zhao,"In this paper, we develop a novel control volume method that is locally conservative and locking-free for linear elasticity problem on quadrilateral grids. The symmetry of stress is weakly imposed through the introduction of a Lagrange multiplier. As such, the method involves three unknowns: stress, displacement and rotation. To ensure the well-posedness of the scheme, a pair of carefully defined finite element spaces is used for the stress, displacement and rotation such that the inf-sup condition holds. An appealing feature of the method is that piecewise constant functions are used for the approximations of stress, displacement and rotation, which greatly simplifies the implementation. In particular, the stress space is defined delicately such that the stress bilinear form is localized around each vertex, which allows for the local elimination of the stress, resulting in a cell-centered system. By choosing different definitions of the space for rotation, we develop two variants of the method. In particular, the first method uses a constant function for rotation over the interaction region, which allows for further elimination and results in a cell-centered system involving displacement only. A rigorous error analysis is performed for the proposed scheme. We show a quasi-optimal approximation (up to data-oscillation term) for $L^2$-error of the stress and rotation without requiring additional regularity assumption. Moreover, we can also prove the superconvergence for discrete $H^1$-error and $L^2$-error of displacement. Extensive numerical simulations indicate that our method is efficient and accurate, and can handle problems with discontinuous coefficients.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.01420v1,New finite volume element schemes based on a two-layer dual strategy,Weizhang Huang; Xiang Wang; Xinyuan Zhang,"A two-layer dual strategy is proposed in this work to construct a new family of high-order finite volume element (FVE-2L) schemes that can avoid main common drawbacks of the existing high-order finite volume element (FVE) schemes. The existing high-order FVE schemes are complicated to construct since the number of the dual elements in each primary element used in their construction increases with a rate $O((k+1)^2)$, where $k$ is the order of the scheme. Moreover, all $k$th-order FVE schemes require a higher regularity $H^{k+2}$ than the approximation theory for the $L^2$ theory. Furthermore, all FVE schemes lose local conservation properties over boundary dual elements when dealing with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The proposed FVE-2L schemes has a much simpler construction since they have a fixed number (four) of dual elements in each primary element. They also reduce the regularity requirement for the $L^2$ theory to $H^{k+1}$ and preserve the local conservation law on all dual elements of the second dual layer for both flux and equation forms. Their stability and $H^1$ and $L^2$ convergence are proved. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the convergence and conservation properties of the FVE-2L schemes. Moreover, the condition number of the stiffness matrix of the FVE-2L schemes for the Laplacian operator is shown to have the same growth rate as those for the existing FVE and finite element schemes.",NA,NA,0,1
2503.07628v1,A finite element model to analyze crack-tip fields in a transversely isotropic strain-limiting elastic solid,Saugata Ghosh; Dambaru Bhatta; S. M. Mallikarjunaiah,"This paper presents a finite element model for the analysis of crack-tip fields in a transversely isotropic strain-limiting elastic body. A nonlinear constitutive relationship between stress and linearized strain characterizes the material response. This algebraically nonlinear relationship is critical as it mitigates the physically inconsistent strain singularities that arise at crack tips. These strain-limiting relationships ensure that strains remain bounded near the crack tip, representing a significant advancement in the formulation of boundary value problems (BVPs) within the context of first-order approximate constitutive models. For a transversely isotropic elastic material containing a crack, the equilibrium equation, derived from the balance of linear momentum under a specified nonlinear constitutive relation, is shown to reduce to a second-order, vector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. A robust numerical method is introduced, integrating Picard-type linearization with a continuous Galerkin-type finite element procedure for spatial discretization. Numerical results, obtained for tensile loading conditions and two distinct material fiber orientations, illustrate that the evolution of crack-tip strains occurs significantly slower than that of the normalized stresses. However, the strain-energy density is most pronounced near the crack tip, consistent with observations from linearized elasticity theory. It is demonstrated that the framework investigated herein can serve as a basis for formulating physically meaningful and mathematically well-defined BVPs, which are essential for exploring crack evolution, damage, nucleation, and failure in anisotropic strain-limiting elastic materials.",NA,NA,0,1

2503.01276v2,A hierarchical approach for multicontinuum homogenization in high contrast media,Wei Xie; Viet Ha Hoang; Yin Yang; Yunqing Huang,"A recently developed upscaling technique, the multicontinuum homogenization method, has gained significant attention for its effectiveness in modeling complex multiscale systems. This method defines multiple continua based on distinct physical properties and solves a series of constrained cell problems to capture localized information for each continuum. However, solving all these cell problems on very fine grids at every macroscopic point is computationally expensive, which is a common limitation of most homogenization approaches for non-periodic problems. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical multicontinuum homogenization framework. The core idea is to define hierarchical macroscopic points and solve the constrained problems on grids of varying resolutions. We assume that the local solutions can be represented as a combination of a linear interpolation of local solutions from preceding levels and an additional correction term. This combination is substituted into the original constrained problems, and the correction term is resolved using finite element (FE) grids of varying sizes, depending on the level of the macropoint. By normalizing the computational cost of fully resolving the local problem to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, we establish that our approach incurs a cost of $\mathcal{O}(L \eta^{(1-L)d})$, highlighting substantial computational savings across hierarchical layers $L$, coarsening factor $\eta$, and spatial dimension $d$.

This method bears similarities with the phase screen method used routinely to solve such problems. The main axis of propagation is discretized by a centered splitting scheme with step $\Delta z$ while the transverse variables are treated by a spectral method after appropriate spatial truncation. The originality of our approach is its theoretical validity even when the typical wavelength $\theta$ of the propagating signal satisfies $\theta\ll\Delta z$. More precisely, we obtain a convergence of order $\Delta z$ in mean-square sense while the errors on statistical moments are of order $(\Delta z)^2$ as expected for standard centered splitting schemes. This is a surprising result as splitting schemes typically do not converge when $\Delta z$ is not the smallest scale of the problem.

To address these challenges, we leverage randomized neural networks (RaNNs), in which the parameters of the hidden layers remain fixed following random initialization. RaNNs compute the output layer parameters using the least-squares method, significantly reducing training time and mitigating optimization errors. In this work, we integrate DeepONets with RaNNs to propose RaNN-DeepONets, a hybrid architecture designed to balance accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, to mitigate the need for extensive data preparation, we introduce the concept of physics-informed RaNN-DeepONets. Instead of relying on data generated through other time-consuming numerical methods, we incorporate PDE information directly into the training process. We evaluate the proposed model on three benchmark PDE problems: diffusion-reaction dynamics, Burgers' equation, and the Darcy flow problem. Through these tests, we assess its ability to learn nonlinear operators with varying input types.

The four-process cycle version, which comprises a water pump section, a boiler/superheater section, a steam turbine section, and a condenser section, was considered. The performance of this thermodynamic power cycle depends on several design parameters. This study varied a single independent variable, the absolute pressure of the condenser, by a factor of 256, from 0.78125 to 200 kPa. The peak pressure and peak temperature in the cycle were fixed at 50 bar (5,000 kPa) and 600{\deg}C, respectively, corresponding to a base case with a base value for the condenser's absolute pressure of 12.5 kPa (0.125 bar). The analysis was performed using the thermodynamics software package Cantera as an extension of the Python programming language. The results suggest that over the range of condenser pressures examined, a logarithmic function can be deployed to describe the dependence of input heat, the net output work, and cycle efficiency on the absolute pressure of the condenser. Each of these three performance metrics decreases as the absolute pressure of the condenser increases.

2502.21099v1,Adaptive Accelerated Proximal Gradient Methods with Variance Reduction for Composite Nonconvex Finite-Sum Minimization,Ganzhao Yuan,"This paper proposes {\sf AAPG-SPIDER}, an Adaptive Accelerated Proximal Gradient (AAPG) method with variance reduction for minimizing composite nonconvex finite-sum functions. It integrates three acceleration techniques: adaptive stepsizes, Nesterov's extrapolation, and the recursive stochastic path-integrated estimator SPIDER. While targeting stochastic finite-sum problems, {\sf AAPG-SPIDER} simplifies to {\sf AAPG} in the full-batch, non-stochastic setting, which is also of independent interest. To our knowledge, {\sf AAPG-SPIDER} and {\sf AAPG} are the first learning-rate-free methods to achieve optimal iteration complexity for this class of \textit{composite} minimization problems. Specifically, {\sf AAPG} achieves the optimal iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^{-2})$, while {\sf AAPG-SPIDER} achieves $\mathcal{O}(N + \sqrt{N} \epsilon^{-2})$ for finding $\epsilon$-approximate stationary points, where $N$ is the number of component functions. Under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) assumption, we establish non-ergodic convergence rates for both methods.

2502.21076v1,A Second-Order Relaxation Flux Solver for Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations based on Generalized Riemann Problem Method,Tuowei Chen; Zhifang Du,"In the finite volume framework, a Lax-Wendrof type second-order flux solver for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is proposed by utilizing a hyperbolic relaxation model. The flux solver is developed by applying the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) method to the relaxation model that approximates the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The GRP-based flux solver includes the effects of source terms in numerical fluxes and treats the stiff source terms implicitly, allowing a CFL condition conventionally used for the Euler equations. The trade-off is to solve linear systems of algebraic equations. The resulting numerical scheme achieves second-order accuracy within a single stage, and the linear systems are solved only once in a time step. The parameters to establish the relaxation model are allowed to be locally determined at each cell interface, improving the adaptability to diverse flow regions. Numerical tests with a wide range of flow problems, from nearly incompressible to supersonic flows with strong shocks, for both inviscid and viscous problems, demonstrate the high resolution of the current second-order scheme.",NA,NA,0,1

With our approach, that uses consistently matrices on ${\mathbb C}^N$ instead of operators on $L^2$, we circumvent a variety of analytical subtleties in the analysis of the original nlQDD equation, e.g. related to positivity of densities or to the quantum exponential function.   Our starting point is spatially discretized quantum Boltzmann equation with a BGK-type collision kernel, from which we derive the discretized nlQDD model in the diffusive limit. Then we verify that solutions dissipate the von-Neumann entropy, which is a known key property of the original nlQDD, and prove global existence of positive solutions, which seems to be a particular feature of the discretization. Our main result concerns convergence of the scheme: discrete solutions converge -- locally uniformly with respect to space and time -- to classical solutions of the the original nlQDD model on any time interval $[0,T)$ on which the latter remain positive. In particular, this extends the existence theory for nlQDD, that has been established only for initial data close to equilibrium so far.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

Nonetheless, understanding the nontrivial solutions' qualitative properties seems limited, partially due to the lack of efficient and reliable numerical methods. In this paper, we design a dedicated numerical method to explore these nontrivial solutions further. We first design an improved adaptive orthogonal basis deflation method by combining the adaptive orthogonal basis method with a bisection-deflation algorithm. We then apply the proposed new method to study the impact of domain changes on multiple solutions of certain nonlinear elliptic equations. When the domain varies from a circular disk to an elliptical disk, the corresponding functional value changes dramatically for some particular solutions, which indicates that these nontrivial solutions in the circular domain may become unstable in the elliptical domain. Moreover, several theoretical results on multiple solutions in existing literature are verified. For the nonlinear Sine-Gordon equation with parameter $\lambda$, nontrivial solutions are found for $\lambda > \lambda_2$, here $\lambda_2$ is the second eigenvalue of the corresponding linear eigenvalue problem. For the singularly perturbed Ginzburg-Landau equation, highly concentrated solutions are numerically found which suggests that their convergent limit is a delta function when the perturbation parameter goes to zero",NA,NA,0,1

Transport and absorption of particles in radiative transfer at different rates lead to a complex interaction between the material and particles that involves highly varying time scales. Resolving these effects can require prohibitively small step sizes, which, combined with nonlinear effects and the particle density's high-dimensional phase space, render conventional numerical methods computationally expensive. This work presents an asymptotic--preserving, mass conservative, rank-adaptive, and parallel integrator for a macro--micro decomposition-based dynamical low-rank approximation of the thermal radiative transfer equations.

Traditional stochastic approximation methods, such as Kiefer-Wolfowitz (KW) and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), typically utilize only two samples per iteration, resulting in imprecise gradient estimates and necessitating diminishing step sizes for convergence. In this paper, we first explore an efficient FD estimate, referred to as correlation-induced FD estimate, which is a batch-based estimate. Then, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically determines the batch size at each iteration. By combining these two components, we develop an algorithm designed to enhance DFO in terms of both gradient estimation efficiency and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we establish the consistency of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that, despite using a batch of samples per iteration, it achieves the same convergence rate as the KW and SPSA methods. Additionally, we propose a novel stochastic line search technique to adaptively tune the step size in practice. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments confirm the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.",NA,NA,0,1

Based on the theory of propagation of chaos, particle approximation method is widely used. Then, a natural question is to investigate the convergence rate of the method (also referred to as the convergence rate of PoC). In fact, the PoC convergence rate is well understood for MV-SDEs with coefficients linearly dependent on the measure, but the rate deteriorates with dimension $d$ under the $L^p$-Wasserstein metric for nonlinear measure-dependent coefficients, even when Lipschitz continuity with respect to the measure is assumed. The main objective of this paper is to establish a dimension-independent convergence result of PoC for MV-SDEs whose coefficients are nonlinear with respect to the measure component but Lipschitz continuous. As a complement we further give the time discretization of the equations and thus verify the convergence rate of PoC using numerical experiments.",NA,NA,0,1

The approach utilizes shape optimization techniques, applying the coupled complex boundary method. By rewriting the problem--characterized by a measured temperature profile and corresponding flux (e.g., from infrared thermography)--into a complex boundary value problem with a complex Robin boundary condition, the method simplifies the over-specified nature of the problem. The size and location of the tumor are identified by optimizing a cost function based on the imaginary part of the solution across the domain. Shape sensitivity analysis is conducted to compute the shape derivative of the functional. An iterative algorithm, which uses the Riesz representative of the gradient, is developed to numerically determine the geometry of the tumor via the finite element method. Additionally, we analyze the mesh sensitivity of the finite element solution of the associated state problem and derive a bound on its variation in terms of mesh deformation and its gradient.

2502.20655v1,Wavelet-based density sketching with functional hierarchical tensor,Xun Tang; Lexing Ying,"We introduce the functional hierarchical tensor under a wavelet basis (FHT-W) ansatz for high-dimensional density estimation in lattice models. Recently, the functional tensor network has emerged as a suitable candidate for density estimation due to its ability to calculate the normalization constant exactly, a defining feature not enjoyed by neural network alternatives such as energy-based models or diffusion models. While current functional tensor network models show good performance for lattice models with weak or moderate couplings, we show that they face significant model capacity constraints when applied to lattice models with strong coupling. To address this issue, this work proposes to perform density estimation on the lattice model under a wavelet transformation. Motivated by the literature on scale separation, we perform iterative wavelet coarsening to separate the lattice model into different scales. Based on this multiscale structure, we design a new functional hierarchical tensor ansatz using a hierarchical tree topology, whereby information on the finer scale is further away from the root node of the tree. Our experiments show that the numerical rank of typical lattice models is significantly lower under appropriate wavelet transformation. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model allows one to model challenging Gaussian field models and Ginzburg-Landau models.",NA,NA,0,1

In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via dynamically truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent local Goursat PDEs by recursively propagating boundary conditions along a directed graph via topological ordering, with dynamic truncation adaptively terminating each local power series expansion when coefficients fall below machine precision, striking an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy. This method achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel, providing (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (e.g., with up to half a million points or more) on a single GPU.

Common methods like sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) often rely on precise derivative estimations, making them vulnerable to data scarcity and noise. This study presents a novel data-driven framework by integrating high order implicit Runge-Kutta methods (IRKs) with the sparse identification, termed IRK-SINDy. The framework exhibits remarkable robustness to data scarcity and noise by leveraging the lower stepsize constraint of IRKs. Two methods for incorporating IRKs into sparse regression are introduced: one employs iterative schemes for numerically solving nonlinear algebraic system of equations, while the other utilizes deep neural networks to predict stage values of IRKs. The performance of IRK-SINDy is demonstrated through numerical experiments on benchmark problems with varied dynamical behaviors, including linear and nonlinear oscillators, the Lorenz system, and biologically relevant models like predator-prey dynamics, logistic growth, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model.

Quantum Magnus algorithms, designed to achieve commutator scaling for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation, have been found to be particularly efficient for such applications. When applied to unbounded Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture, they exhibit an unexpected superconvergence phenomenon. However, existing proofs are limited to the spatially continuous setting and do not extend to discrete spatial discretizations. In this work, we provide the first superconvergence estimate in the fully discrete setting with a finite number of spatial discretization points $N$, and show that it holds with an error constant uniform in $N$. The proof is based on the two-parameter symbol class, which, to our knowledge, is applied for the first time in algorithm analysis.

However, their relationship remains unexplored. This study theoretically examines the solutions of these two methods, and reveals that they are not generally equivalent, despite coinciding at the collocation points. Strictly speaking, Stenger's method assumes that the kernel of the integral is a function of a single variable, but this study theoretically justifies the use of his method in general cases, i.e., the kernel is a function of two variables. Then, this study rigorously proves that both methods can attain the same, root-exponential convergence.

Additionally, the authors propose learnable Pad\'e-type activation functions based on Pad\'e approximation theory, which empirically outperform classical ReLU, Taylor-based activations, and PAU. By combining these innovations, PSNN demonstrates superior performance in learning and forecasting diverse Hamiltonian systems (e.g., modified pendulum, galactic dynamics), surpassing state-of-the-art models in accuracy, long-term stability, and energy preservation, while requiring shorter training time, fewer samples, and reduced parameters.

This work presents a deep-learning-based multi-model evaluation and downscaling framework ranking 32 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models using a Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS) mechanism and so refines outputs using advanced deep-learning models. Using nine performance criteria, five K\""oppen-Geiger climate zones -- Tropical, Arid, Temperate, Continental, and Polar -- are investigated over four seasons. While TaiESM1 and CMCC-CM2-SR5 show notable biases, ranking results show that NorESM2-LM, GISS-E2-1-G, and HadGEM3-GC31-LL outperform other models. Four models contribute to downscaling the top-ranked GCMs to 0.1$^{\circ}$ resolution: Vision Transformer (ViT), Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware Network (GeoSTANet), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Effectively capturing temperature extremes (TXx, TNn), GeoSTANet achieves the highest accuracy (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.57$^{\circ}$C, Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) = 0.89, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.85, Correlation ($r$) = 0.92), so reducing RMSE by 20% over ConvLSTM. CNN-LSTM and ConvLSTM do well in Continental and Temperate zones; ViT finds fine-scale temperature fluctuations difficult.

They face however significant challenges in industrial applications, such as slow convergence, limit cycle oscillations, or iterations blow-up. An ideal preconditioner is rarely available and naive approaches such as Richardson iterations often fail to converge on complex cases, calling for generic sophistications such as deflation techniques and/or Krylov subspaces approaches. However the quest for an optimal general linear solver is still open and a matter of active research.   This paper introduces a new theoretical framework, called DFPI (Deflated Fixed Point Iterations) for the iterative solution of linear systems. It unifies several existing acceleration and stabilization techniques such as RPM, BoostConv and Anderson acceleration, and bridges the gap between Richardson iterations and Krylov subspace methods, including GMRES, PCG, BiCGStab and variants. DFPI is structured around two key building blocks : the choice of a projection operator, on the one hand and the trouble vectors recruitment strategy, on the other hand. A general convergence result will be presented, showing the choice of a specific projection operator has minimal impact as long as the projection space remains invariant by the iteration matrix. However when this is not guaranteed, a minimization principle becomes a must have. Finally numerical comparisons will be conducted on a variety of relevant CFD cases.",NA,NA,0,1

It is based on approximating the tail probability in question with the most probable realization of the stochastic process, and local perturbations around this realization. We first recall and contextualize the relevant classical theoretical result on precise Laplace asymptotics of diffusion processes [Ben Arous (1988), Stochastics, 25(3), 125-153], and then show how to compute the involved infinite-dimensional quantities - operator traces and Carleman-Fredholm determinants - numerically in a way that is scalable with respect to the time discretization and remains feasible in high spatial dimensions. Using tools from automatic differentiation, we achieve a straightforward black-box numerical computation of the SORM estimates in JAX. The method is illustrated in examples of SDEs and stochastic partial differential equations, including a two-dimensional random advection-diffusion model of a passive scalar. We thereby demonstrate that it is possible to obtain efficient and accurate SORM estimates for very high-dimensional problems, as long as the infinite-dimensional structure of the problem is correctly taken into account. Our JAX implementation of the method is made publicly available.",NA,NA,0,1

Soenjaya,"The current-induced magnetisation dynamics in a ferromagnet at elevated temperatures can be described by the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (LLB) equation with spin-torque terms. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the global strong solution to the model in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$, with an additional smallness assumption on the initial data if $d=3$. We then propose a fully discrete linearly implicit finite element scheme for the problem and prove that it approximates the solution with an optimal order of convergence, provided the exact solution possesses adequate regularity. Furthermore, we propose an unconditionally energy-stable finite element method to approximate the LLB equation without spin current. This scheme also converges to the exact solution at an optimal order, and is shown to be energy-dissipative at the discrete level. Finally, some numerical simulations to complement the theoretical analysis are included.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2502.20086v1,"Subspace accelerated measure transport methods for fast and scalable sequential experimental design, with application to photoacoustic imaging",Tiangang Cui; Karina Koval; Roland Herzog; Robert Scheichl,"We propose a novel approach for sequential optimal experimental design (sOED) for Bayesian inverse problems involving expensive models with large-dimensional unknown parameters. The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.",NA,NA,0,1

The proposed numerical formulation is based on least-squares formulation. The mesh is aligned with the interface, and the interface is completely resolved using blending element functions. The higher-order spectral element functions are nonconforming, and the same-order approximation is used for both velocity and pressure variables. The interface conditions are added to the minimizing functional in appropriate Sobolev norms. Stability and error estimates are proven. The proposed method is shown to be exponentially accurate in both velocity and pressure variables. The theoretical estimates are validated through various numerical examples.",NA,NA,0,1

This results in a nonlinear, nonsymmetric saddle point multiphysics system, for which the nonlinearity is handled via the Newton method. The iterative solution of the arising linear system is accelerated by using robust and highly scalable, overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioners. It is well-known that a one-level method of this type is not scalable and therefore a second level has to be added. Therefore, the construction and numerical analysis of monolithic, two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioners with different variants of the GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) coarse space are presented here. A new and parallel efficient implementation of several variants of GDSW, that is, GDSW, RGDSW, and GDSW*, in PETSc, is introduced, which is usable for multiphysics problems, as, for example, the thermo-mechanical LBW problem considered here. Different combinations of the GDSW variants for the different fields (temperature and displacements) are compared and parallel scalability for realistic problems is shown.",NA,NA,0,1

In this paper, we integrate the TransNet technique with the nonoverlapping domain decomposition and the interface conditions to develop a novel multiple transferable neural network (Multi-TransNet) method for solving elliptic interface problems, which typically contain discontinuities in both solutions and their derivatives across interfaces. We first propose an empirical formula for the TransNet to characterize the relationship between the radius of the domain-covering ball, the number of hidden-layer neurons, and the optimal neuron shape. In the Multi-TransNet method, we assign each subdomain one distinct TransNet with an adaptively determined number of hidden-layer neurons to maintain the globally uniform neuron distribution across the entire computational domain, and then unite all the subdomain TransNets together by incorporating the interface condition terms into the loss function. The empirical formula is also extended to the Multi-TransNet and further employed to estimate appropriate neuron shapes for the subdomain TransNets, greatly reducing the parameter tuning cost. Additionally, we propose a normalization approach to adaptively select the weighting parameters for the terms in the loss function. Ablation studies and extensive experiments with comparison tests on different types of elliptic interface problems with low to high contrast diffusion coefficients in two and three dimensions are carried out to numerically demonstrate the superior accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed Multi-TransNet method.",NA,NA,0,1

Calculating the active element patterns for large number of array requires full-wave analyses of total array structure, which is time consuming. To obtain accurate active element patterns efficiently, this letter proposes a method to estimates active element patterns in largely arrayed antenna using directional decomposition approach. Reducing computational cost, proposed method constructs the transfer matrices to reflect both mutual coupling and truncation effects between each antenna element. Numerical validation with open-ended waveguides confirms that the proposed method can estimate active element patterns with high accuracy. The synthesized beam patterns show mean squared errors below 0.1dB in the main lobe region for various beam steering cases. The computational complexity for numerical analysis reduces from $\mathcal{O}(M_B^2(N_x^3 N_y^3))$ to $\mathcal{O}(M_B^2(N_x^3 + N_y^3))$, resulting in a reduction of computation time to under 0.095\% compared to the conventional active element pattern method.",NA,NA,0,1

Furthermore, we derive sharp upper bounds for the partial NCN, MCN and CCN, which are computationally efficient and free of expensive Kronecker products. By applying perturbations that preserve the structure of the block matrices of the DSPPs, we analyze the structured partial NCN, MCN and CCN when the block matrices exhibit linear structures. By leveraging the relationship between DSPP and equality constrained indefinite least squares (EILS) problems, we recover the partial CNs for the EILS problem. Numerical results confirm the sharpness of the derived upper bounds and demonstrate their effectiveness in estimating the partial CNs.",NA,NA,0,1

In general, nonlinear solution methods and optimization methods have a rich body of work spanning back to at least the first century, providing the opportunity for advancement in the field of computational discrete damage modeling. In this paper, we explore the performance of established methods when applied to problems involving cohesive zone models to identify promising methods for further improvement in this specialized application. We first use a simple 1D example problem with low degrees of freedom (DoF) to compare nonlinear solution methods, thereby allowing for both straightforward and intuitive visualization of the residual space and reasoning about the cause for each method's performance. We then explore the impact of higher DoF discretizations of the same problem on the performance of the solution methods.

2502.19578v2,Inexact subspace projection methods for low-rank tensor eigenvalue problems,Alec Dektor; Peter DelMastro; Erika Ye; Roel Van Beeumen; Chao Yang,"We compare two approaches for solving high-dimensional eigenvalue problems with low-rank structure: the inexact Lanczos method and inexact polynomial-filtered subspace iteration. Inexactness stems from low-rank compression, enabling efficient representation of high-dimensional vectors in a low-rank tensor format. A primary challenge in these methods is that standard operations, such as matrix-vector products and linear combinations, increase tensor rank, necessitating rank truncation and hence approximation. The Lanczos method constructs an approximate orthonormal Krylov basis, which is often difficult to represent accurately using low-rank tensor formats, even when the eigenvectors themselves exhibit low-rank structure. In contrast, the low-rank polynomial-filtered subspace iteration uses approximate eigenvectors (Ritz vectors) directly as a subspace basis, bypassing the need for an orthonormal Krylov basis. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that inexact subspace iteration is much more robust to rank-truncation errors compared to the inexact Lanczos method. We further demonstrate that rank-truncated subspace iteration can converge for problems where the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) stagnates.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.19543v1,High-fidelity Multiphysics Modelling for Rapid Predictions Using Physics-informed Parallel Neural Operator,Biao Yuan; He Wang; Yanjie Song; Ana Heitor; Xiaohui Chen,"Modelling complex multiphysics systems governed by nonlinear and strongly coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone in computational science and engineering. However, it remains a formidable challenge for traditional numerical solvers due to high computational cost, making them impractical for large-scale applications. Neural operators' reliance on data-driven training limits their applicability in real-world scenarios, as data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. Here, we propose a novel paradigm, physics-informed parallel neural operator (PIPNO), a scalable and unsupervised learning framework that enables data-free PDE modelling by leveraging only governing physical laws. The parallel kernel integration design, incorporating ensemble learning, significantly enhances both compatibility and computational efficiency, enabling scalable operator learning for nonlinear and strongly coupled PDEs. PIPNO efficiently captures nonlinear operator mappings across diverse physics, including geotechnical engineering, material science, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and fluid dynamics. The proposed method achieves high-fidelity and rapid predictions, outperforming existing operator learning approaches in modelling nonlinear and strongly coupled multiphysics systems. Therefore, PIPNO offers a powerful alternative to conventional solvers, broadening the applicability of neural operators for multiphysics modelling while ensuring efficiency, robustness, and scalability.",NA,NA,0,1

Shepherd; Deepesh Toshniwal; Rafael Vázquez,"Studying the de Rham complex is a natural choice when working with problems in electromagnetics and fluid mechanics. By discretizing the complex correctly, it is possible to attain stable numerical methods to tackle these problems. An important consideration when constructing the discrete complex is that it must preserve the cohomology structure of the original one. This property is not guaranteed when the discrete function spaces chosen are hierarchical B-splines. Research shows that a poor choice of refinement domains may give rise to spurious harmonic forms that ruin the accuracy of solutions, even for the simplest partial differential equations. Another crucial aspect to consider in the hierarchical setting is the notion of admissibility, as it is possible to obtain optimal convergence rates of numerical solutions by limiting the multi-level interaction of basis functions. We will focus on the two-dimensional de Rham complex over the unit square $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$. In this scenario, the discrete de Rham complex should be exact, and we provide both the theoretical and the algorithm-implementation framework to ensure this is the case. Moreover, we show that, under a common restriction, the admissibility class of the first space of the discrete complex persists throughout the remaining spaces.

This classical concept assumes the validity of Fourier's law, which states the heat flux is proportional to temperature gradient, with heat conductivity used to denote this ratio. However, this macroscopic constitutive relation breaks down at nano-scales. Instead, heat is propagated using phonon transport equation, an ab initio model derived from the first principle. In this equation, a material's thermal property is coded in a coefficient termed the relaxation time ($\tau$). We study an inverse problem in this paper, by using material's temperature response upon heat injection to infer the relaxation time. This inverse problem is formulated in a PDE-constrained optimization, and numerically solved by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method and its variants. In the execution of SGD, Fr\'echet derivative is computed and Lipschitz continuity is proved. This approach, in comparison to the earlier studies, honors the nano-structure of of heat conductivity in a nano-material, and we numerically verify the break down of the Fourier's law.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2502.19510v1,Numerical shape and topology optimization of regions supporting the boundary conditions of a physical problem,Eric Bonnetier; Carlos Brito-Pacheco; Charles Dapogny; Rafael Estevez,"This article deals with a particular class of shape and topology optimization problems: the optimized design is a region $G$ of the boundary $\partial \Omega$ of a given domain $\Omega$, which supports a particular type of boundary conditions in the considered physical problem. In our analyses, we develop adapted versions of the notions of shape and topological derivatives, which are classically tailored to functions of a ``bulk'' domain. This leads to two complementary notions of derivatives for a quantity of interest $J(G)$ depending on a region $G \subset \partial \Omega$: on the one hand, we elaborate on the boundary variation method of Hadamard for evaluating the sensitivity of $J(G)$ with respect to ``small'' perturbations of the boundary of $G$ within $\partial \Omega$. On the other hand, we use techniques from asymptotic analysis to appraise the sensitivity of $J(G)$ with respect to the addition of a new connected component to the region $G$, shaped as a ``small'' surface disk. The calculation of both types of derivatives raises original difficulties, which are carefully detailed in a simple mathematical setting based on the conductivity equation. We notably propose formal arguments to calculate our derivatives with a minimum amount of technicality, and show how they can be generalized to handle more intricate problems, arising for instance in the contexts of acoustics and structural mechanics, respectively governed by the Helmholtz and linear elasticity equations. In numerical applications, our derivatives are incorporated into a recent algorithmic framework for tracking arbitrarily dramatic motions of a region $G$ within a fixed ambient surface, which combines the level set method with remeshing techniques to offer a clear, body-fitted discretization of the evolving region.

The local well-posedness of homogeneous boundary value problem for non-stationary viscous Burgers equation is established by using semigroup techniques and fixed point arguments. By considering a suitable approximate problem and deriving appropriate energy estimates, we prove the existence of a unique strong solution. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the global well-posedness of the non-homogeneous problem. For both the stationary and non-stationary cases, we derive explicit error estimates in suitable Lebesgue and Sobolev norms by optimizing a loss function in a Deep Neural Network approximation of the solution with fixed complexity.

2502.19290v1,PhysicsSolver: Transformer-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Forward and Forecasting Problems in Partial Differential Equations,Zhenyi Zhu; Yuchen Huang; Liu Liu,"Time-dependent partial differential equations are a significant class of equations that describe the evolution of various physical phenomena over time. One of the open problems in scientific computing is predicting the behaviour of the solution outside the given temporal region. Most traditional numerical methods are applied to a given time-space region and can only accurately approximate the solution of the given region. To address this problem, many deep learning-based methods, basically data-driven and data-free approaches, have been developed to solve these problems. However, most data-driven methods require a large amount of data, which consumes significant computational resources and fails to utilize all the necessary information embedded underlying the partial differential equations (PDEs). Moreover, data-free approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) may not be that ideal in practice, as traditional PINNs, which primarily rely on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), tend to overlook the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in real-world physical systems. We propose a method denoted as \textbf{PhysicsSolver} that merges the strengths of two approaches: data-free methods that can learn the intrinsic properties of physical systems without using data, and data-driven methods, which are effective at making predictions.

In this study, we design the smoothness indicator for the downwind substencil by simply summing up all local smoothness indicators and taking the average, which includes the regularity information of the whole stencil. Accordingly the JS-type and Z-type nonlinear weights, based on simple local smoothness indicators, are developed for the fourth-order central-upwind WENO scheme.

2502.19120v1,Reduced order models for time-dependent problems using the Laplace transform,Ricardo Reyes,"We propose a reduced basis method to solve time-dependent partial differential equations based on the Laplace transform. Unlike traditional approaches, we start by applying said transform to the evolution problem, yielding a time-independent boundary value problem that depends on the complex Laplace parameter. First, in an offline stage, we appropriately sample the Laplace parameter and solve the collection of problems using the finite element method. Next, we apply a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to this collection of solutions in order to obtain a reduced basis that is of dimension much smaller than that of the original solution space. This reduced basis, in turn, is then used to solve the evolution problem using any suitable time-stepping method. A key insight to justify the formulation of the method resorts to Hardy spaces of analytic functions. By applying the widely-known Paley-Wiener theorem we can then define an isometry between the solution of the time-dependent problem and its Laplace transform. As a consequence of this result, one may conclude that computing a POD with samples taken in the Laplace domain produces an exponentially accurate reduced basis for the time-dependent problem. Numerical experiments characterizing the performance of the method, in terms of accuracy and speed-up, are included for a variety of relevant time-evolution equations.",NA,NA,0,1

2502.19088v2,A Nonlinear Extension of the Variable Projection (VarPro) Method for NURBS-based Conformal Surface Flattening,Masaaki Miki,"In the field of computer graphics, conformal surface flattening has been widely studied for tasks such as texture mapping, geometry processing, and mesh generation. Typically, existing methods aim to flatten a given input geometry while preserving conformality as much as possible, meaning the result is only as conformal as possible. By contrast, this study focuses on surfaces that can be flattened conformally without singularities, making the process a coupled problem: the input (or target) surface must be recursively refined while its flattening is computed.   Although the uniformization theorem or the Riemann mapping theorem guarantees the existence of a conformal flattening for any simply connected, orientable surface, those theorems permit singularities in the flattening. If singularities are not allowed, only a special class of surfaces can be conformally flattened-though many practical surfaces do fall into this class.   To address this, we develop a NURBS-based approach in which both the input surface and its flattening are refined in tandem, ensuring mutual conformality. Because NURBS surfaces cannot represent singularities, the resulting pair of surfaces is naturally singularity-free. Our work is inspired by the form-finding method by [Miki and Mitchell 2022, 2024], which solves bilinear PDEs by iteratively refining two surfaces together. Building on their demonstration of the effectiveness of variable projection (VarPro), we adopt a similar strategy: VarPro alternates between a linear projection and a nonlinear iteration, leveraging a partially linear (separable) problem structure. However, since our conformal condition separates into two nonlinear subproblems, we introduce a nonlinear extension of VarPro. Although this significantly increases computational cost, the quality of the results is noteworthy.",NA,NA,0,1

Russell Luke; Stefan Mathias,"The main challenge of nonconvex optimization is to find a global optimum, or at least to avoid ``bad'' local minima and meaningless stationary points. We study here the extent to which algorithms, as opposed to optimization models and regularization, can be tuned to accomplish this goal. The model we consider is a nonconvex, inconsistent feasibility problem with many local minima, where these are points at which the gaps between the sets are smallest on neighborhoods of these points. The algorithms that we compare are all projection-based algorithms, specifically cyclic projections, the cyclic relaxed Douglas-Rachford algorithm, and relaxed Douglas-Rachford splitting on the product space. The local convergence and fixed points of these algorithms have already been characterized in pervious theoretical studies. We demonstrate the theory for these algorithms in the context of orbital tomographic imaging from angle-resolved photon emission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements, both synthetically generated and experimental. Our results show that, while the cyclic projections and cyclic relaxed Douglas-Rachford algorithms generally converge the fastest, the method of relaxed Douglas-Rachford splitting on the product space does move away from bad local minima of the other two algorithms, settling eventually on clusters of local minima corresponding to globally optimal critical points.",NA,NA,0,1

Such a scheme is proven to be pressure robust and Reynolds semi-robust. Standard techniques can be used to analyze only the case of lowest-order approximations in time. Therefore, we use some nonstandard test functions to prove existence of discrete solutions, unconditional stability, and quasi-optimal convergence rates for any degree of approximation in time. In particular, a continuous dependence of the discrete solution on the data of the problem, and quasi-optimal convergence rates for low and high Reynolds numbers are proven in an energy norm including the term $L^{\infty}(0, T; L^2(\Omega)^d)$ for the velocity.

Our primary focus is on two critical numerical aspects related to coupling conditions: the preservation of the conservation property and ensuring stability. Notably, a key oversight in some existing literature on coupling methods is the neglect of upholding the conservation property within the overall scheme. This oversight forms the central theme of the initial part of our research. As a first step, we limited ourselves to explicit schemes on uniform grids. Implicit schemes and the consideration of varying mesh sizes at the interface will be reserved for a subsequent paper \cite{CMW3}. Another paper \cite{CMW2} will address the issue of stability.   We examine these schemes from the perspective of finite differences, including finite elements, following the application of a nodal quadrature rule. Additionally, we explore a finite volume-based scheme involving cells and flux considerations. Our analysis reveals that discrete boundary and flux coupling conditions uphold the conservation property in distinct ways in nodal-based and cell-based schemes. The coupling conditions under investigation encompass well-known approaches such as Dirichlet-Neumann coupling, heat flux coupling, and specific channel and pumping flux conditions drawn from the field of biophysics. The theoretical findings pertaining to the conservation property are corroborated through computations across a range of test cases.",NA,NA,0,1

The output of our stochastic optimal control implementation consists of an optimal trajectory in a square domain for the autonomous vehicle such that the total mission time is minimized for a given residual risk of not detecting sea mines. We model this risk as an expected value integral. We found that upon completion of the simulation, the user requested residual risk is usually not satisfied. We solved this by implementing a relaxation strategy which consists of incrementally increasing the square search domain. We then combined this strategy with different quasi-Monte Carlo schemes used for solving the integral. We found that using a Rank-1 Lattice scheme yields a speedup up to a factor two with respect to the Monte Carlo scheme. We also present an implementation which allows us to compute a trajectory in a convex quadrilateral domain, as opposed to a square domain, and combine it with our relaxation strategy.",NA,NA,0,1

Atomistic-to-continuum (a/c) coupling methods, a typical class of concurrent multiscale methods, link atomic-scale simulations with continuum mechanics. Existing a/c methods adopt the classic second-order Cauchy-Born approximation as the continuum mechanics model. In this work, we employ a higher-order Cauchy-Born model to study the potential accuracy improvement of the coupling scheme. In particular, we develop an energy-based blended atomistic to higher-order continuum method and present a rigorous a priori error analysis. We show that the overall accuracy of the energy-based blended method is not actually improved due the coupling interface error which is of lower order and may not be improved. On the contrast, higher order accuracy is achieved by the force-based blended atomistic to higher-order continuum method.

The model does not own the gradient flow structure as the usual Allen-Cahn equation does, and the random splitting method is advantageous due to its simplicity and better convergence rate. Though the random splitting is a classical method, the analysis of the convergence is not straightforward for this model due to the nonlinearity and unboundedness of the operators. We obtain uniform estimates of various Sobolev norms of the numerical solutions and the stability of the model. Based on the Sobolev estimates, the local trunction errors are then rigorously obtained.

To accelerate this process, we developed a low-precision, mathematically-equivalent algorithm called PASA, based on Flash Attention. PASA introduces two novel techniques: online pseudo-average shifting and global recovering. These techniques enable the use of half-precision computation throughout the Flash Attention process without incurring overflow instability or unacceptable numerical accuracy loss. This algorithm enhances performance on memory-restricted AI hardware architectures, such as the Ascend Neural-network Processing Unit(NPU), by reducing data movement and increasing computational FLOPs. The algorithm is validated using both designed random benchmarks and real large models. We find that the large bias and amplitude of attention input data are critical factors contributing to numerical overflow ($>65504$ for half precision) in two different categories of large models (Qwen2-7B language models and Stable-Video-Diffusion multi-modal models). Specifically, overflow arises due to the large bias in the sequence dimension and the resonance mechanism between the query and key in the head dimension of the Stable-Video-Diffusion models. The resonance mechanism is defined as phase coincidence or 180-degree phase shift between query and key matrices. It will remarkably amplify the element values of attention score matrix. This issue also applies to the Qwen models. Additionally, numerical accuracy is assessed through root mean square error (RMSE) and by comparing the final generated texts and videos to those produced using high-precision attention.",NA,NA,0,1

2502.18626v1,Stochastic trace estimation for parameter-dependent matrices applied to spectral density approximation,Fabio Matti; Haoze He; Daniel Kressner; Hei Yin Lam,"Stochastic trace estimation is a well-established tool for approximating the trace of a large symmetric matrix $\mathbf{B}$. Several applications involve a matrix that depends continuously on a parameter $t \in [a,b]$, and require trace estimates of $\mathbf{B}(t)$ for many values of $t$. This is, for example, the case when approximating the spectral density of a matrix. Approximating the trace separately for each matrix $\mathbf{B}(t_1), \dots, \mathbf{B}(t_m)$ clearly incurs redundancies and a cost that scales linearly with $m$. To address this issue, we propose and analyze modifications for three stochastic trace estimators, the Girard-Hutchinson, Nystr\""om, and Nystr\""om++ estimators. Our modification uses \emph{constant} randomization across different values of $t$, that is, every matrix $\mathbf{B}(t_1), \dots, \mathbf{B}(t_m)$ is multiplied with the \emph{same} set of random vectors. When combined with Chebyshev approximation in $t$, the use of such constant random matrices allows one to reuse matrix-vector products across different values of $t$, leading to significant cost reduction. Our analysis shows that the loss of stochastic independence across different $t$ does not lead to deterioration. In particular, we show that $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ random matrix-vector products suffice to ensure an error of $\varepsilon > 0$ for Nystr\""om++, independent of low-rank properties of $\mathbf{B}(t)$. We discuss in detail how the combination of Nystr\""om++ with Chebyshev approximation applies to spectral density estimation and provide an analysis of the resulting method. This improves various aspects of an existing stochastic estimator for spectral density estimation. Several numerical experiments from electronic structure interaction, statistical thermodynamics, and neural network optimization validate our findings.",NA,NA,0,1

Morgan,"The inverse of a large matrix can often be accurately approximated by a polynomial of degree significantly lower than the order of the matrix. The iteration polynomial generated by a run of the GMRES algorithm is a good candidate, and its approximation to the inverse often seems to track the accuracy of the GMRES iteration. We investigate the quality of this approximation through theory and experiment, noting the practical need to add copies of some polynomial terms to improve stability. To mitigate storage and orthogonalization costs, other approaches have appeal, such as polynomial preconditioned GMRES and deflation of problematic eigenvalues. Applications of such polynomial approximations include solving systems of linear equations with multiple right-hand sides (where the solutions to subsequent problems come simply by multiplying the polynomial against the new right-hand sides) and variance reduction in multilevel Monte Carlo methods.",NA,NA,0,1

Nevertheless, the process can be streamlined by emphasizing the automatic determination of structure geometry, potentially reducing the reliance on traditional methods that heavily rely on engineering insight in the course of antenna development. In this work, which is an extension of our conference paper [1], a specification-oriented design of topologically agnostic antennas is considered by utilizing two strategies focused on bandwidth-specific design and bandwidth-enhanced optimization. The process is embedded within a variable-fidelity framework, where the low-fidelity optimization involves classification of randomly generated topologies, followed by their local tuning using a trust-region algorithm applied to a feature-based representation of structure response. The final result is then tuned using just a handful of high-fidelity simulations. The strategies under consideration were verified on a case study basis concerning automatic generation of three radiators with varying parameters. Benchmarks of the algorithm against more standard optimization methods, as well as comparisons of the obtained topologies with respect to state-of-the-art antennas from literature have also been considered.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.18155v1,Local iterative algorithms for approximate symmetry guided by network centralities,David Hartman; Jaroslav Hlinka; Anna Pidnebesna; František Szczepanik,"Recently, the influence of potentially present symmetries has begun to be studied in complex networks. A typical way of studying symmetries is via the automorphism group of the corresponding graph. Since complex networks are often subject to uncertainty and automorphisms are very sensitive to small changes, this characterization needs to be modified to an approximate version for successful application. This paper considers a recently introduced approximate symmetry of complex networks computed as an automorphism with acceptance of small edge preservation error, see Liu 2020. This problem is generally very hard with respect to the large space of candidate permutations, and hence the corresponding computation methods typically lead to the utilization of local algorithms such as the simulated annealing used in the original work. This paper proposes a new heuristic algorithm extending such iterative search algorithm method by using network centralities as heuristics. Centralities are shown to be a good tool to navigate the local search towards more appropriate permutations and lead to better search results.",NA,NA,0,1

On some examples, preconditioned LSQR is seen to produce errors many orders of magnitude larger than classical direct methods; this paper demonstrates that the attainable accuracy of preconditioned LSQR can be greatly improved by applying iterative refinement or restarting when the accuracy stalls. This observation is supported by rigorous backward error analysis.

2502.17671v2,Optimal Recovery Meets Minimax Estimation,Ronald DeVore; Robert D. Nowak; Rahul Parhi; Guergana Petrova; Jonathan W. Siegel,"A fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning is to estimate a function $f$ from possibly noisy observations of its point samples. The goal is to design a numerical algorithm to construct an approximation $\hat f$ to $f$ in a prescribed norm that asymptotically achieves the best possible error (as a function of the number $m$ of observations and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the noise). This problem has received considerable attention in both nonparametric statistics (noisy observations) and optimal recovery (noiseless observations). Quantitative bounds require assumptions on $f$, known as model class assumptions. Classical results assume that $f$ is in the unit ball of a Besov space. In nonparametric statistics, the best possible performance of an algorithm for finding $\hat f$ is known as the minimax rate and has been studied in this setting under the assumption that the noise is Gaussian. In optimal recovery, the best possible performance of an algorithm is known as the optimal recovery rate and has also been determined in this setting. While one would expect that the minimax rate recovers the optimal recovery rate when the noise level $\sigma$ tends to zero, it turns out that the current results on minimax rates do not carefully determine the dependence on $\sigma$ and the limit cannot be taken. This paper handles this issue and determines the noise-level-aware (NLA) minimax rates for Besov classes when error is measured in an $L_q$-norm with matching upper and lower bounds. The end result is a reconciliation between minimax rates and optimal recovery rates. The NLA minimax rate continuously depends on the noise level and recovers the optimal recovery rate when $\sigma$ tends to zero.",NA,NA,0,1

A conjecture that is supported by several numerical phenomena in \cite[Figure 2.5]{Buvoli2018}, the method appears to remain stable when the accuracy approaches infinity, although it is not yet proven. It is regrettable that this hypothesis has been refuted from a fundamental perspective in harmonic analysis. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, this method displays considerably enhanced stability in comparison to conventional explicit schemes. Furthermore, we present a criterion for ascertaining the maximum permissible accuracy for a given specific parabolic stability radius. Conversely, the original method will lose one order associated with the expected accuracy, which can be recovered with a slight modification. Consequently, a unified analysis strategy for the \( L^2 \)-stability will be presented for extensional PDEs under the CFL condition. Finally, a selection of representative numerical examples will be shown in order to substantiate the theoretical analysis.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.17217v1,A Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method for cell-centred finite volume solid mechanics,Philip Cardiff; Dylan Armfield; Željko Tuković; Ivan Batistić,"This study investigates the efficacy of Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods in finite-volume solid mechanics. Traditional Newton-based approaches require explicit Jacobian matrix formation and storage, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. In contrast, Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods approximate the Jacobian's action using finite differences, combined with Krylov subspace solvers such as the generalised minimal residual method (GMRES), enabling seamless integration into existing segregated finite-volume frameworks without major code refactoring. This work proposes and benchmarks the performance of a compact-stencil Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method against a conventional segregated approach on a suite of test cases, encompassing varying geometric dimensions, nonlinearities, dynamic responses, and material behaviours. Key metrics, including computational cost, memory efficiency, and robustness, are evaluated, along with the influence of preconditioning strategies and stabilisation scaling. Results show that the proposed Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method outperforms the segregated approach in all linear and nonlinear elastic cases, achieving order-of-magnitude speedups in many instances; however, divergence is observed in elastoplastic cases, highlighting areas for further development. It is found that preconditioning choice impacts performance: a LU direct solver is fastest in small to moderately-sized cases, while a multigrid method is more effective for larger problems. The findings demonstrate that Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods are promising for advancing finite-volume solid mechanics simulations, particularly for existing segregated frameworks where minimal modifications enable their adoption.

While deep networks are capable of approximating complex functions, direct one-shot training often faces limitations in both accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive method that uses single-hidden-layer neural networks to construct basis functions guided by the equation residual. The approximate solution is computed within the space spanned by these basis functions, employing a collocation least squares scheme. As the approximation space gradually expands, the solution is iteratively refined; meanwhile, the progressive improvements serve as reliable {\it a posteriori} error indicators that guide the termination of the sequential updates. Additionally, we introduce adaptive strategies for collocation point selection and parameter initialization to enhance robustness and improve the expressiveness of the neural networks. We also derive the approximation error estimate and validate the proposed method with several numerical experiments on various challenging PDEs, demonstrating both high accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.",NA,NA,0,1

The dependency of the corresponding elastic energy on the in-plane displacement $u$ and the out-of-plane deflection $w$ leads to a practical minimization of the functional via a decoupled gradient flow. In particular, the energies of the resulting iterates are shown to be monotonically decreasing. The discretization of the model relies on $P1$ finite elements for the horizontal part $u$ and utilizes the discrete Kirchhoff triangle for the vertical component $w$.

The a/c methods aim to balance the accuracy and efficiency by coupling a molecular mechanics model (also termed as the atomistic model) in the vicinity of localized defects with the Cauchy-Born approximation of the atomistic model in the elastic far field. However, since both the molecular mechanics model and its Cauchy-Born approximation are usually a nonlinear, it potentially leads to a high computational cost for large-scale simulations. In this work, we propose an advancement of the classic quasinonlocal (QNL) a/c coupling method by incorporating a linearized Cauchy-Born model to reduce the computational cost. We present a rigorous a priori error analysis for this QNL method with linear elasticity enhancement (QNLL method), and show both analytically and numerically that it achieves the same convergence behavior as the classic (nonlinear) QNL method by proper determination of certain parameters relating to domain decomposition and finite element discretization. More importantly, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the QNLL method perform an substantial improvement of the computational efficiency in term of CPU times.",NA,NA,0,1

It is widely recognized that explicit Euler or Milstein methods may blow up when the system exhibits superlinear growth, and modifications are needed. Hence we propose an adaptive variant to deal with the case of superlinear growth drift coefficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to develop a numerical method with variable step sizes for nonlinear SDEPCAs. It is proven that the adaptive Milstein method is strongly convergent in the sense of $L_p, p\ge 2$, and the convergence rate is optimal, which is consistent with the order of the explicit Milstein scheme with globally Lipschitz coefficients.

We consider two methods for this question.   First, a method based on Delsarte's LP-bound from coding theory which will give us, among others, the Fibonacci lattices as the natural candidates for optimal point sets. Second, we will adapt the continuous LP-bound on the sphere (and other spaces) to the torus to get optimality in the continuous setting.   We conclude with a more in depth look at the $5$-point Fibonacci lattice, giving an effectively computable algorithm for checking if it is optimal and rigorously proving its optimality for quasi-Monte Carlo integration in the range $0 < p \leq 11.66$. We also prove a result on the universal optimality of $3$ points in any dimension.

2502.17016v1,BGG Sequences -- A Riemannian perspective,Andreas Cap,"BGG resolutions and generalized BGG resolutions from representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras have been generalized to sequences of invariant differential operators on manifolds endowed with a geometric structure belonging to the family of parabolic geometries. Two of these structures, conformal structures and projective structures occur as weakenings of a Riemannian metric respectively of a specified torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle. In particular, one obtains BGG sequences on open subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ as very special cases of the construction. It turned out that several examples of the latter sequences are of interest in applied mathematics, since they can be used to construct numerical methods to study operators relevant for elasticity theory, numerical relativity and related fields.   This article is intended to provide an intermediate level between BGG sequences for parabolic geometries and the case of domains in $\mathbb R^n$. We provide a construction of conformal BGG sequences on Riemannian manifolds and of projective BGG sequences on manifolds endowed with a volume preserving linear connection on their tangent bundle. These constructions do not need any input from parabolic geometries. Except from standard differential geometry methods the only deeper input comes from representation theory. So one can either view the results as a simplified version of the constructions for parabolic geometries in an explicit form. Alternatively, one can view them as providing an extension of the simplified constructions for domains in $\Bbb R^n$ to general Riemannian manifolds or to manifolds endowed with an appropriate connection on the tangent bundle.",NA,NA,0,1

Driven by the need to get a practical variant of the BCG algorithm well suited for computations in finite precision arithmetic, we also discuss some important variants of BCG due to Dubrulle. These variants avoid the troubles with a possible rank deficiency within the block vectors. We show how to incorporate preconditioning and computation of Lanczos coefficients into these variants.

Specifically, we employ a classical processor for structural analysis with the finite element method, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is subsequently performed to update the cross-sectional area so that the compliance is minimized. The advantages of this framework can be seen in three key aspects. First, by defining design variables as multipliers, rather than simply reducing the design variable to a binary candidate of inclusion or exclusion (corresponding to qubit states, ``0"" and ``1""), it provides greater flexibility in adjusting the cross-sectional area of the rod at each iteration of the optimization process. Second, the multipliers acting on rods are encoded with on-off encoding, eliminating additional constraints in the convergence judgement. As a result, the objective function is in a simple format, enabling efficient optimization using QAOA.Third, a fixed linear ramp schedule (FLRS) for variational parameter setting bypasses the classical optimization process, thereby improving the operational efficiency of the framework. In the two structural cases investigated in this study, the proposed approach highlights the feasibility and applicability potential of quantum computing in advancing engineering design and optimization.

However, reduced fracture models also face accuracy challenges due to modeling errors and uncertainties in physical parameters such as permeability and fracture geometry. To address these challenges, we propose a United Filter method, which integrates the Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) for state estimation with the Direct Filter for parameter estimation. EnSF, based on a score-based diffusion model framework, produces ensemble representations of the state distribution without deep learning. Meanwhile, the Direct Filter, a recursive Bayesian inference method, estimates parameters directly from state observations. The United Filter combines these methods iteratively: EnSF estimates are used to refine parameter values, which are then fed back to improve state estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the United Filter method surpasses the state-of-the-art Augmented Ensemble Kalman Filter, delivering more accurate state and parameter estimation for reduced fracture models. This framework also provides a robust and efficient solution for PDE-constrained inverse problems with uncertainties and sparse observations.",NA,NA,0,1

Its formula is similar to that of the determinant, however unlike the determinant, its exact computation is #P-complete, i.e., there is no algorithm to compute the permanent in polynomial time unless P=NP. For an $n \times n$ matrix, the fastest algorithm has a time complexity of $O(2^{n-1}n)$. Although supercomputers have been employed for permanent computation before, there is no work and more importantly, no publicly available software that leverages cutting-edge, yet widely accessible, High-Performance Computing accelerators such as GPUs. In this work, we designed, developed, and investigated the performance of SUperman, a complete software suite that can compute matrix permanents on multiple nodes/GPUs on a cluster while handling various matrix types, e.g., real/complex/binary and sparse/dense etc., with a unique treatment for each type. Compared to a state-of-the-art parallel algorithm on 44 cores, SUperman can be $86\times$ faster on a single Nvidia A100 GPU. Combining multiple GPUs, we also showed that SUperman can compute the permanent of a $56 \times 56$ matrix which is the largest reported in the literature.",NA,NA,0,1

By employing a mass lumping scheme to diagonalize the mass matrix, the matrix inversion procedures can be avoided, thereby significantly enhancing computational efficiency especially in the explicit part. In addition, after decoupling the resulting system, higher order time discretization techniques can be applied to get better accuracy within the same time step size. Furthermore, the spatial space is divided into two components: contrast-dependent (""fast"") and contrast-independent (""slow"") subspaces. Using this decomposition, our objective is to introduce an appropriate time splitting method that ensures stability and guarantees contrast-independent discretization under suitable conditions. We analyze the stability and convergence of the proposed algorithm. In particular, we discuss the second order central difference and higher order Runge-Kutta method for a wave equation.

Existing methods face significant obstacles: Gaussian-based filters struggle with non-Gaussian distributions, while sequential Monte Carlo methods are computationally intensive and prone to particle degeneracy in high dimensions. Although generative models in machine learning have made significant progress in modeling high-dimensional non-Gaussian distributions, their inefficiency in online updating limits their applicability to filtering problems. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-based Bayesian filter (FBF) that integrates normalizing flows to construct a novel latent linear state-space model with Gaussian filtering distributions. This framework facilitates efficient density estimation and sampling using invertible transformations provided by normalizing flows, and it enables the construction of filters in a data-driven manner, without requiring prior knowledge of system dynamics or observation models.

The BAT algorithm operates deterministically, while the Monte Carlo simulation method is stochastic. By hybridizing these two approaches, BAT-MCS successfully reduces variance, increases efficiency, and improves the quality of its binary-state network reliability. However, it has two notable weaknesses. First, the selection of the supervectors, sub-vectors that form the core of BAT-MCS, is overly simplistic, potentially affecting overall performance. Second, the calculation of the approximate reliability is complicated, which limits its strength in reducing variance. In this study, a new BAT-MCS called cBAT-MCS is proposed to enhance the performance of the BAT-MCS. The approach reduces the complexity of MCS. Selecting the super-vector based on a novel layer-cut approach can reduce both runtime and variance. Extensive numerical experiments on large-scale binary-state network demonstrate that the proposed new cBAT-MCS outperforms traditional MCS and original BAT-MCS approaches in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.",NA,NA,0,1

The main objective of the proposed virtual elements is to develop a stabilized virtual element problem that avoids higher-order derivative terms and bilinear forms involving velocity, pressure and temperature, thereby avoiding the coupling between virtual element pairs. Moreover, it also reduces the violation of divergence-free constraints and offers reasonable control over the gradient of temperature. We derive the stability of the continuous solution using the Banach fixed-point theorem under sufficiently small data. The stabilized coupled virtual element problem is formulated using the local projection-based stabilization methods. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the stabilized discrete solution using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and the contraction theorem under the assumption of sufficient small data by showing the well-posedness of the stabilized decoupled virtual element problems.

The MRCM-OS methodology demonstrated the ability to achieve flux error magnitudes on the order of $10^{-4}$ in a challenging industry benchmark, namely the SPE10 permeability field. The two newly proposed iterative procedures, through the construction of online informed spaces, significantly enhance the solution accuracy, reaching flux error magnitudes of order $10^{-10}$ for a reduced number of steps.

Unfortunately, the properties of these accelerators are not widely understood and lack sufficient descriptions of their behavior. This makes it difficult for tool builders beyond the original vendor to target or simulate the hardware correctly, or for algorithm designers to be confident in their code. To address these gaps, prior studies have probed the behavior of these units with manually crafted tests. Such tests are cumbersome to design, and adapting them as the accelerators evolve requires repeated manual effort.   We present a formal model for the tensor cores of Nvidia's Volta, Turing, and Ampere GPUs. We identify specific properties -- rounding mode, precision, and accumulation order -- that drive these cores' behavior. We formalize these properties and then use the formalization to automatically generate discriminating inputs that illustrate differences among machines. Our results confirm many of the findings of previous tensor core studies, but also identify subtle disagreements. In particular, Nvidia's machines do not, as previously reported, use round-to-zero for accumulation, and their 5-term accumulator requires 3 extra carry-out bits for full accuracy. Using our formal model, we analyze two existing algorithms that use half-precision tensor cores to accelerate single-precision multiplication with error correction.

Domain decomposition methods, particularly one-level Schwarz methods, offer a promising framework to tackle these challenges, with recent advancements showing the potential for weak scalability under certain conditions. In this paper, we analyze the weak scalability of one-level Schwarz methods for Maxwell's equations in strip-wise domain decompositions, focusing on waveguides with general cross sections and different types of transmission conditions such as impedance or perfectly matched layers (PMLs). By combining techniques from the limiting spectrum analysis of Toeplitz matrices and the modal decomposition of Maxwell's solutions, we provide a novel theoretical framework that extends previous work to more complex geometries and transmission conditions. Numerical experiments confirm that the limiting spectrum effectively predicts practical behavior even with a modest number of subdomains.

One of the long-standing drawbacks of DOM is the phenomenon known as the ray effect. Due to the high dimensionality of the RTE, DOM results in a large algebraic system to solve. The Source Iteration (SI) method is the most standard iterative method for solving this system. In this paper, by introducing randomness into the SI method, we propose a novel random source iteration (RSI) method that offers a new way to mitigate the ray effect without increasing the computational cost. We have rigorously proved that RSI is unbiased with respect to the SI method and that its variance is uniformly bounded across iteration steps; thus, the convergence order with respect to the number of samples is $1/2$. Furthermore, we prove that the RSI iteration process, as a Markov chain, is ergodic under mild assumptions.

It is based on the splitting of the flux function into two or more subsystems separating the different scales of the considered model whose stiff components are relaxed thus yielding a linear structure of the resulting relaxation model on the relaxation variables. This allows the construction of a linearly implicit numerical scheme, where convective processes are discretized explicitly. Thanks to this linearity, the discrete scheme can be reformulated in linear decoupled wave-type equations resulting in the same number of evolved variables as in the original system. To obtain a scale independent numerical diffusion, centred fluxes are applied on the implicitly treated terms, whereas classical upwind schemes are applied on the explicit parts. The numerical scheme is validated by applying it on the Toro & V\'azquez-Cend\'on (2012) splitting of the Euler equations and the Fambri (2021) splitting of the ideal MHD equations where the flux is split in two, respectively three sub-systems.

In the absence of closed-form solutions, one relies on numerical methods to approximate the solution. The level set method -- when coupled with the finite element method -- is one of the most versatile numerical shape optimization approaches but still suffers from the limitations of most mesh-based methods. In this work, we present a fully meshless level set framework that leverages neural networks to parameterize the level set function and employs the graph Laplacian to approximate the underlying PDE. Our approach enables precise computations of geometric quantities such as surface normals and curvature, and allows tackling optimization problems within the class of convex shapes.",NA,NA,0,1

We then derive reliable and efficient estimators for a broad class of stabilized first-order finite element methods.

Explicit stabilized time stepping methods can be attractive for time integration of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, especially on parallel and hybrid supercomputers. In this paper, we propose an exponential time integration method for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and describe its efficient Krylov subspace based implementation.

This scheme calculates the Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes equations separately, thus effectively decoupling the entire system. To further separate the velocity and pressure components in the Navier-Stokes equations, we use the pressure-correction projection method. We demonstrate that the scheme is primitively energy stable and prove the optimal $L^2$ error estimate of the fully discrete scheme in the $P_r\times P_r\times P_r\times P_{r-1}$ finite element spaces, where the phase field, chemical potential, velocity and pressure satisfy the first-order accuracy in time and the $\left(r+1,r+1,r+1,r\right)th$-order accuracy in space, respectively.

Vazquez-Mendez,"In this paper, a useful reinterpretation of the city as a porous medium justifies the application of well-known models on fluid dynamics to develop a multi-model study of urban air pollution due to traffic flow in a large city. Thus, to simulate the traffic flow through the city we use a nonconservative macroscopic traffic model combining the continuity equation with the Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer equations. For the air flow, regarding the emission rate of CO$_2$ and its dispersion in the atmosphere, we combine a microscopic model -- based on regression techniques but depending on vehicles' velocity and acceleration -- with a classical convection-diffusion-reaction transport model. To solve numerically above PDEs models, the finite element method of Lagrange $\rm{P_1}$ type along with suitable time marching schemes (like the strong stability preserving scheme) were sufficient to obtain stable numerical solutions. Several computational tests were run on a realistic scenario inspired by the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara (Mexico), showing not only the influence of the urban landscape (that is, the porosity) on traffic flow, air flow, and pollution transport, but also other interesting phenomena such as rarefaction traffic waves.",NA,NA,0,1

It is based upon the projection on Hermite polynomials in velocity and orthonormal polynomials with respect to the weight $e^{-\phi}$ in space. The potential $\phi$ is assumed to be a polynomial. It is, to the author's knowledge, the first scheme which preserves hypocoercive behavior in addition to the conservation laws.

2502.14284v1,An efficient and accurate semi-implicit time integration scheme for dynamics in nearly- and fully-incompressible hyperelastic solids,Edward M. Terrell; Boyce E. Griffith,"The choice of numerical integrator in approximating solutions to dynamic partial differential equations depends on the smallest time-scale of the problem at hand. Large-scale deformations in elastic solids contain both shear waves and bulk waves, the latter of which can travel infinitely fast in incompressible materials. Explicit schemes, which are favored for their efficiency in resolving low-speed dynamics, are bound by time step size restrictions that inversely scale with the fastest wave speed. Implicit schemes can enable larger time step sizes regardless of the wave speeds present, though they are much more computationally expensive. Semi-implicit methods, which are more stable than explicit methods and more efficient than implicit methods, are emerging in the literature, though their applicability to nonlinear elasticity is not extensively studied. In this research, we develop and investigate the functionality of two time integration schemes for the resolution of large-scale dynamics in nearly- and fully-incompressible hyperelastic solids: a Modified Semi-implicit Backward Differentiation Formula integrator (MSBDF2) and a forward Euler / Semi-implicit Backward Differentiation Formula Runge-Kutta integrator (FEBDF2). We prove and empirically verify second order accuracy for both schemes. The stability properties of both methods are derived and numerically verified. We find FEBDF2 has a maximum time step size that inversely scales with the shear wave speed and is unaffected by the bulk wave speed -- the desired stability property of a semi-implicit scheme. Finally, we empirically determine that semi-implicit schemes struggle to preserve volume globally when using nonlinear incompressibility conditions, even under temporal and spatial refinement.",NA,NA,0,1

The control problem is discretized using the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin (SIPG) technique. We derive both reliable and efficient type residual-based error estimators coupling with the data oscillations. The implementation of these error estimators serves as a guide for the adaptive mesh refinement process, indicating whether or not more refinement is required. Although the control error estimator effectively captured control approximation errors, it had limitations in guiding refinement localization in critical cases. To overcome this, an alternative control indicator was used in numerical tests. The results demonstrated the clear superiority of adaptive refinements over uniform refinements, confirming the proposed approach's effectiveness in achieving accurate solutions while optimizing computational efficiency. numerical experiment showcases the effectiveness of the derived error estimators.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.14213v1,Asynchronous Stochastic Block Projection Algorithm for Solving Linear Systems under Predefined Communication Patterns,Yanchen Yin; Yongli Wang,"Distributed computation over networks is now receiving an increasing attention in many fields such as engineering and machine learning, where the solution of a linear system of equations is a basic task. This paper presents an asynchronous distributed randomized block Kaczmarz projection algorithm for solving large-scale linear systems over a multi-agent networks, where each agent only holds a part of the problem data. An event-triggered communication mechanism is integrated to minimize the communication overhead and reduce the overall communication costs. This communication mechanism allows each agent to update independently in an asynchronous environment and dynamically regulate communication frequency. In addition, this article analyzes the inefficiency caused by communication in asynchronous algorithms, explores the potential of event triggering mechanisms in alleviating these problems, and provides general conditions for global convergence in such environments. Moreover, a modified stochastic block Kaczmarz algorithm is used for each agent to update their local estimate. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, the exponential convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is established for a consistent system and its computational efficiency, robustness, and communication efficiency is validated through extensive numerical experiments. Furthermore, to address inconsistent systems, the algorithm introduces auxiliary variables to facilitate convergence toward an approximate least-squares solution, accompanied by a formal error analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains stability even under extreme asynchrony, communication failures, and node failures, while achieving significantly lower communication overhead and faster convergence rates compared to traditional methods.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.14206v1,Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Variational Inequalities,Giuliano Stefano Fochesatto,"Variational inequalities play a pivotal role in a wide array of scientific and engineering applications. This project presents two techniques for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in the context of variational inequalities, with a specific focus on the classical obstacle problem.   We propose two distinct AMR strategies: Variable Coefficient Elliptic Smoothing (VCES) and Unstructured Dilation Operator (UDO). VCES uses a nodal active set indicator function as the initial iterate to a time-dependent heat equation problem. Solving a single step of this problem has the effect of smoothing the indicator about the free boundary. We threshold this smoothed indicator function to identify elements near the free boundary. Key parameters such as timestep and threshold values significantly influence the efficacy of this method.   The second strategy, UDO, focuses on the discrete identification of elements adjacent to the free boundary, employing a graph-based approach to mark neighboring elements for refinement. This technique resembles the dilation morphological operation in image processing, but tailored for unstructured meshes.   We also examine the theory of variational inequalities, the convergence behavior of finite element solutions, and implementation in the Firedrake finite element library. Convergence analysis reveals that accurate free boundary estimation is pivotal for solver performance. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in dynamically enhancing mesh resolution around free boundaries, thereby improving the convergence rates and computational efficiency of variational inequality solvers. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing Firedrake numerical solvers, and it is promising for solving more complex free boundary problems.",NA,NA,0,1

The classical notion of a retraction map leads to the notion of discretization map extended here to the Lie algebroid of a Lie groupoid so that the configuration manifold is discretized, instead of the equations of motion. As a consequence, geometric integrators are obtained preserving the Lie-Poisson structure of the corresponding reduced system.",NA,NA,0,1

Although some nonlinear solvers and algebraic modeling languages implement variable aggregation as a pre-solve, the impact it can have on constrained nonlinear programs is unexplored. In this work, we formalize variable aggregation as a pre-solve algorithm to develop reduced-space formulations of nonlinear programs. A novel approximate maximum variable aggregation strategy is developed to aggregate as many variables as possible. Furthermore, aggregation strategies that preserve the problem structure are compared against approximate maximum aggregation. Our results show that variable aggregation can generally help to improve the convergence reliability of nonlinear programs. It can also help in reducing total solve time. However, Hessian evaluation can become a bottleneck if aggregation significantly increases the number of variables appearing nonlinearly in many constraints.",NA,NA,0,1

The numerical approach is inspired by the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD), so that we do not require structural assumptions such as periodicity or scale separation and only need minimal regularity assumptions on the coefficient.To construct the multiscale space, we solve linear fine-scale problems on small local subdomains, for which we consider two different linearization techniques. For both, we present a rigorous well-posedness analysis and convergence estimates in the $H^1$-semi norm.

2502.13675v1,A CFL condition for the finite cell method,Tim Bürchner; Lars Radtke; Philipp Kopp,"Immersed boundary finite element methods allow the user to bypass the potentially troublesome task of boundary-conforming mesh generation. However, they suffer from the influence of cut elements, i.e., elements that are intersected by the physical domain boundaries. When combined with explicit time integration, poorly cut elements with little support in the physical domain have a detrimental effect on the critical time step size, thereby hampering the application of immersed boundary methods to wave propagation simulations. In this paper, we investigate the stabilizing effect of the finite cell method concerning explicit time integration. Starting with an analytical solution of an example with one degree of freedom, we systematically study the influence of $\alpha$-stabilization on the maximum eigenvalue and thus on the critical time step size. The analysis is then complemented by a numerical study of an example with one element and an increasing polynomial degree. We demonstrate that the critical time step size does not decrease below a certain limit, even when further reducing the cut fraction of the element. This minimum critical time step size is controlled by the chosen $\alpha$ value and becomes less severe for higher dimensions. Increasing the polynomial degree has little effect on the degradation of the minimum critical time step size. Finally, we provide an estimate of the minimum critical time step size depending on the chosen stabilization parameter $\alpha$ and the dimension of the problem. Based on this estimate, we propose a modified CFL condition for the finite cell method, the validity of which we demonstrate on a numerical example of a perforated plate.",NA,NA,0,1

Mahoney,"A substantial body of work in machine learning (ML) and randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA) has exploited various sorts of random sketching methodologies, including random sampling and random projection, with much of the analysis using Johnson--Lindenstrauss and subspace embedding techniques. Recent studies have identified the issue of inversion bias -- the phenomenon that inverses of random sketches are not unbiased, despite the unbiasedness of the sketches themselves. This bias presents challenges for the use of random sketches in various ML pipelines, such as fast stochastic optimization, scalable statistical estimators, and distributed optimization.   In the context of random projection, the inversion bias can be easily corrected for dense Gaussian projections (which are, however, too expensive for many applications). Recent work has shown how the inversion bias can be corrected for sparse sub-gaussian projections. In this paper, we show how the inversion bias can be corrected for random sampling methods, both uniform and non-uniform leverage-based, as well as for structured random projections, including those based on the Hadamard transform. Using these results, we establish problem-independent local convergence rates for sub-sampled Newton methods.",NA,NA,0,1

2502.13038v1,How far are two symmetric matrices from commuting? With an application to object characterisation and identification in metal detection,P. D. Ledger; W. R. B. Lionheart; J. Elgy,"Examining the extent to which measurements of rotation matrices are close to each other is challenging due measurement noise. To overcome this, data is typically smoothed and Riemannian and Euclidean metrics are applied. However, if rotation matrices are not directly measured and are instead formed by eigenvectors of measured symmetric matrices, this can be problematic if the associated eigenvalues are close. In this work, we propose novel semi-metrics that can be used to approximate the Riemannian metric for small angles. Our new results do not require eigenvector information and are beneficial for measured datasets. There are also issues when using comparing rotational data arising from computational simulations and it is important that the impact of the approximations on the computed outputs is properly assessed to ensure that the approximations made and the finite precision arithmetic are not unduly polluting the results. In this work, we examine data arising from object characterisation in metal detection using the complex symmetric rank two magnetic polarizability tensor (MPT) description, we rigorously analyse the effects of our numerical approximations and apply our new approximate measures of distance to the commutator of the real and imaginary parts of the MPT to this application.

The key innovation is that we 1) approximate the kernel by the probability density function of an Erlang mixture and 2) use the linear chain trick to transform the approximate DDEs to ODEs. Furthermore, we prove that an approximation with infinitely many terms converges for continuous and bounded kernels and for specific choices of the coefficients. We compare the steady states of the original DDEs and their stability criteria to those of the approximate system of ODEs, and we propose an approach based on bisection and least-squares estimation for determining optimal parameter values in the approximation. Finally, we present numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy and convergence rate obtained with the optimal parameters and the efficacy of the proposed approach for bifurcation analysis and Monte Carlo simulation.

2502.12940v1,Tensor cross interpolation for global discrete optimization with application to Bayesian network inference,Sergey Dolgov; Dmitry Savostyanov,"Global discrete optimization is notoriously difficult due to the lack of gradient information and the curse of dimensionality, making exhaustive search infeasible. Tensor cross approximation is an efficient technique to approximate multivariate tensors (and discretized functions) by tensor product decompositions based on a small number of tensor elements, evaluated on adaptively selected fibers of the tensor, that intersect on submatrices of (nearly) maximum volume. The submatrices of maximum volume are empirically known to contain large elements, hence the entries selected for cross interpolation can also be good candidates for the globally maximal element within the tensor. In this paper we consider evolution of epidemics on networks, and infer the contact network from observations of network nodal states over time. By numerical experiments we demonstrate that the contact network can be inferred accurately by finding the global maximum of the likelihood using tensor cross interpolation. The proposed tensor product approach is flexible and can be applied to global discrete optimization for other problems, e.g. discrete hyperparameter tuning.",NA,NA,0,1

The cases of medical, biomedical, and industrial imaging systems are the typical examples. A very high overview of classification of the inverse problems method can be: i) Analytical, ii) Regularization, and iii) Bayesian inference methods. Even if there are straight links between them, we can say that the Bayesian inference based methods are the most powerful, as they give the possibility of accounting for prior knowledge and can account for errors and uncertainties in general. One of the main limitations stay in computational costs in particular for high dimensional imaging systems. Neural Networks (NN), and in particular Deep NNs (DNN), have been considered as a way to push farther this limit. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) concept integrates physical laws with deep learning techniques to enhance the speed, accuracy and efficiency of the above mentioned problems.

2502.12877v1,Pushing the Limits of the Reactive Affine Shaker Algorithm to Higher Dimensions,Roberto Battiti; Mauro Brunato,"Bayesian Optimization (BO) for the minimization of expensive functions of continuous variables uses all the knowledge acquired from previous samples (${\boldsymbol x}_i$ and $f({\boldsymbol x}_i)$ values) to build a surrogate model based on Gaussian processes. The surrogate is then exploited to define the next point to sample, through a careful balance of exploration and exploitation. Initially intended for low-dimensional spaces, BO has recently been modified and used also for very large-dimensional spaces (up to about one thousand dimensions).   In this paper we consider a much simpler algorithm, called ""Reactive Affine Shaker"" (RAS). The next sample is always generated with a uniform probability distribution inside a parallelepiped (the ""box""). At each iteration, the form of the box is adapted during the search through an affine transformation, based only on the point $\boldsymbol x$ position and on the success or failure in improving the function. The function values are therefore not used directly to modify the search area and to generate the next sample. The entire dimensionality is kept (no active subspaces).   Despite its extreme simplicity and its use of only stochastic local search, surprisingly the produced results are comparable to and not too far from the state-of-the-art results of high-dimensional versions of BO, although with some more function evaluations.   An ablation study and an analysis of probability distribution of directions (improving steps and prevailing box orientation) in very large-dimensional spaces are conducted to understand more about the behavior of RAS and to assess the relative importance of the algorithmic building blocks for the final results.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.12810v1,"Frequency-domain alignment of heterogeneous, multidimensional separations data through complex orthogonal Procrustes analysis",Michael Sorochan Armstrong,"Multidimensional separations data have the capacity to reveal detailed information about complex biological samples. However, data analysis has been an ongoing challenge in the area since the peaks that represent chemical factors may drift over the course of several analytical runs along the first and second dimension retention times. This makes higher-level analyses of the data difficult, since a 1-1 comparison of samples is seldom possible without sophisticated pre-processing routines. Further complicating the issue is the fact that closely co-eluting components will need to be resolved, typically using some variants of Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC), Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR), or the recently explored Shift-Invariant Multi-linearity. These algorithms work with a user-specified number of components, and regions of interest that are then summarized as a peak table that is invariant to shift. However, identifying regions of interest across truly heterogeneous data remains an ongoing issue, for automated deployment of these algorithms. This work offers a very simple solution to the alignment problem through a orthogonal Procrustes analysis of the frequency-domain representation of synthetic multidimensional separations data, for peaks that are logarithmically transformed to simulate shift while preserving the underlying topology of the data. Using this very simple method for analysis, two synthetic chromatograms can be compared under close to the worst possible scenarios for alignment.",NA,NA,0,1

This is usually achieved by defining a pairwise node similarity matrix and then clustering rows and columns of this matrix. This paper presents a new similarity matrix for solving role extraction problems in directed networks, which is defined as the solution of a matrix equation and computes node similarities based on random walks that can proceed along the link direction and in the opposite direction. The resulting node similarity measure performs remarkably in role extraction tasks on directed networks with heterogeneous node degree distributions.",NA,NA,0,1

Compared to the standard CR gospel, the present construction allows for the use of nested bases of increasing degree and is particularly suited to design variable order CR methods. We analyze a nonconforming discretization of a two dimensional Poisson problem, which requires a DG-type stabilization; the employed stabilization parameter is considerably smaller than that needed in DG methods. Numerical results are presented, which exhibit the expected convergence rates for the $h$-, $p$-, and $hp$-versions of the scheme. We further investigate numerically the behaviour of new even degree CR-type discretizations of the Stokes' equations.",NA,NA,0,1

Sloan,"In this paper we consider Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with a smooth activation function as surrogates for high-dimensional functions that are somewhat smooth but costly to evaluate. We consider the standard (non-periodic) DNNs as well as propose a new model of periodic DNNs which are especially suited for a class of periodic target functions when Quasi-Monte Carlo lattice points are used as training points. We study the regularity of DNNs by obtaining explicit bounds on all mixed derivatives with respect to the input parameters. The bounds depend on the neural network parameters as well as the choice of activation function. By imposing restrictions on the network parameters to match the regularity features of the target functions, we prove that DNNs with $N$ tailor-constructed lattice training points can achieve the generalization error (or $L_2$ approximation error) bound ${\tt tol} + \mathcal{O}(N^{-r/2})$, where ${\tt tol}\in (0,1)$ is the tolerance achieved by the training error in practice, and $r = 1/p^*$, with $p^*$ being the ``summability exponent'' of a sequence that characterises the decay of the input variables in the target functions, and with the implied constant independent of the dimensionality of the input data. We apply our analysis to popular models of parametric elliptic PDEs in uncertainty quantification. In our numerical experiments, we restrict the network parameters during training by adding tailored regularization terms, and we show that for an algebraic equation mimicking the parametric PDE problems the DNNs trained with tailored regularization perform significantly better.",NA,NA,0,1

Kuo; Dirk Nuyens; Ian H. Sloan; Euan A. Spence,"We analyse and implement a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) finite element method (FEM) for the forward problem of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for the Helmholtz equation with random coefficients, both in the second-order and zero-order terms of the equation, thus modelling wave scattering in random media. The problem is formulated on the infinite propagation domain, after scattering by the heterogeneity, and also (possibly) a bounded impenetrable scatterer. The spatial discretization scheme includes truncation to a bounded domain via a perfectly matched layer (PML) technique and then FEM approximation. A special case is the problem of an incident plane wave being scattered by a bounded sound-soft impenetrable obstacle surrounded by a random heterogeneous medium, or more simply, just scattering by the random medium. The random coefficients are assumed to be affine separable expansions with infinitely many independent uniformly distributed and bounded random parameters. As quantities of interest for the UQ, we consider the expectation of general linear functionals of the solution, with a special case being the far-field pattern of the scattered field. The numerical method consists of (a) dimension truncation in parameter space, (b) application of an adapted QMC method to compute expected values, and (c) computation of samples of the PDE solution via PML truncation and FEM approximation. Our error estimates are explicit in $s$ (the dimension truncation parameter), $N$ (the number of QMC points), $h$ (the FEM grid size) and (most importantly), $k$ (the Helmholtz wavenumber). The method is also exponentially accurate with respect to the PML truncation radius. Illustrative numerical experiments are given.",NA,NA,0,1

Therefore, careful consideration is required when using numerical methods to solve these equations because of the Gibbs phenomenon. A remedy based on the Schwartz duality has been proposed, yielding superior results without oscillations. However, this approach has been limited to linear problems and still suffers from the Gibbs phenomenon for nonlinear problems. In this note, we propose a consistent yet simple approach based on Schwartz duality that can handle nonlinear problems. Our proposed approach utilizes a modified direct projection method with a discrete derivative of the Heaviside function, which directly approximates the Dirac delta function. This proposed method effectively eliminates Gibbs oscillations without the need for traditional regularization and demonstrates uniform error reduction.",NA,NA,0,1

We parameterize the random domain using the model recently considered by Chernov and Le (2024) as well as Harbrecht, Schmidlin, and Schwab (2024) in which the input random field is assumed to belong to a Gevrey smoothness class. This approach has the advantage of being substantially more general than models which assume a particular parametric representation of the input random field such as a Karhunen-Loeve series expansion. We consider both the Poisson equation as well as the heat equation and design randomly shifted lattice quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) cubature rules for the computation of the expected solution under domain uncertainty. We show that these QMC rules exhibit dimension-independent, essentially linear cubature convergence rates in this framework.

2502.12298v1,Symmetric Rank-One Quasi-Newton Methods for Deep Learning Using Cubic Regularization,Aditya Ranganath; Mukesh Singhal; Roummel Marcia,"Stochastic gradient descent and other first-order variants, such as Adam and AdaGrad, are commonly used in the field of deep learning due to their computational efficiency and low-storage memory requirements. However, these methods do not exploit curvature information. Consequently, iterates can converge to saddle points or poor local minima. On the other hand, Quasi-Newton methods compute Hessian approximations which exploit this information with a comparable computational budget. Quasi-Newton methods re-use previously computed iterates and gradients to compute a low-rank structured update. The most widely used quasi-Newton update is the L-BFGS, which guarantees a positive semi-definite Hessian approximation, making it suitable in a line search setting. However, the loss functions in DNNs are non-convex, where the Hessian is potentially non-positive definite. In this paper, we propose using a limited-memory symmetric rank-one quasi-Newton approach which allows for indefinite Hessian approximations, enabling directions of negative curvature to be exploited. Furthermore, we use a modified adaptive regularized cubics approach, which generates a sequence of cubic subproblems that have closed-form solutions with suitable regularization choices. We investigate the performance of our proposed method on autoencoders and feed-forward neural network models and compare our approach to state-of-the-art first-order adaptive stochastic methods as well as other quasi-Newton methods.x",NA,NA,0,1

Here we present pylevin, a Python package to efficiently compute integrals containing up to three Bessel functions of arbitrary order and arguments. The implementation makes use of Levin's method and allows for accurate and fast integration of these highly oscillatory integrals. In benchmarking pylevin against existing software for single Bessel function integrals, we find its speed comparable, usually within a factor of two, to specialised packages such as FFTLog. Furthermore, when dealing with integrals containing two or three Bessel functions, pylevin delivers performance up to four orders of magnitude faster than standard adaptive quadrature methods, while also exhibiting better stability for large Bessel function arguments. pylevin is available from source via github or directly from PyPi.",NA,NA,0,1

However, computational fluid dynamics simulations remain relatively costly in a clinical context. Moreover, projection-based reduced-order models and purely data-driven surrogate models struggle due to the high variability of anatomical shapes in a population. A possible solution is shape registration: a reference template geometry is designed from a cohort of available geometries, which can then be diffeomorphically mapped onto it. This provides a natural encoding that can be exploited by machine learning architectures and, at the same time, a reference computational domain in which efficient dimension-reduction strategies can be performed. We compare state-of-the-art graph neural network models with recent data assimilation strategies for the prediction of physical quantities and clinically relevant biomarkers in the context of aortic coarctation.",NA,NA,0,1

Hille,"Various biological cells secrete diffusing chemical compounds into their environment for communication purposes. Secretion usually takes place over the cell membrane in a spatially heterogeneous manner. Mathematical models of these processes will be part of more elaborate models, e.g. of the movement of immune cells that react to cytokines in their environment. Here, we compare two approaches to modelling of the secretion-diffusion process of signalling compounds. The first is the so-called spatial exclusion model, in which the intracellular space is excluded from consideration and the computational space is the extracellular environment. The second consists of point source models, where the secreting cell is replaced by one or more non-spatial point sources or sinks, using -- mathematically -- Dirac delta distributions. We propose a multi-Dirac approach and provide explicit expressions for the intensities of the Dirac distributions. We show that two to three well-positioned Dirac points suffice to approximate well a temporally constant but spatially heterogeneous flux distribution of compound over the cell membrane, for a wide range of variation in flux density and diffusivity. The multi-Dirac approach is compared to a single-Dirac approach that was studied in previous work.

2502.11907v1,Evaluating singular and near-singular integrals on $C^2$ smooth surfaces with a novel geometric method and closed form expressions,Andrew Zheng; Spyros Alexakis; Adam R Stinchcombe,"Most Fredholm integral equations involve integrals with weakly singular kernels. Once the domain of integration is discretized into elements, these weakly singular kernels become strongly singular or ``near-singular"". Common methods to compute these integrals when the kernel is a Green's function include the Duffy transform, polar coordinates with closed analytic formulas, and singularity extraction. However, these methods do not generalize well to the normal derivatives of Green's functions. We provide methods to integrate both the Green's function and its normal derivative on smooth surfaces discretized by triangular elements in three dimensions. For strongly singular integrals involving normal derivatives of Green's functions, we provide two methods that can accurately approximate the true integrals on the true domain. The Geometric method uses geometric information of the true surface of integration to approximate the original integral on the true domain using push-forward maps. The Interpolation-Duffy method heuristically cancels out the singularity and then evaluates the integral using a quadrature scheme. Both methods are better than simply setting the singular integrals to zero, while being faster than adaptive refinement methods.

Traditional dimensionality reduction methods like POD struggle with these scenarios due to slowly decaying Kolmogorov widths. To overcome this, we propose a novel non-linear dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the required modes for representation. The non-linear reduction is obtained through a POD after applying a transformation on the fields, which we call optimal mappings, and is a solution to an optimization problem in infinite dimension. The proposed learning framework combines morphing techniques, non-linear dimensionality reduction, and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The problem is reformulated on a reference geometry before applying the dimensionality reduction. Our method learns both the optimal mapping, and the solution fields, using a series of GPR models, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of complex parametric PDEs with geometrical variability.

Traditional optimization methods require substantial computational time and effort due to their reliance on resource-intensive simulations, such as finite element analysis, and the complexity of rigorous optimization algorithms. Data-agnostic AI-based surrogate models, such as Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs), offer a promising alternative to these conventional simulations, providing drastically reduced inference time, unparalleled data efficiency, and zero-shot super-resolution capability. However, the predictive accuracy of these models is often constrained to small, low-dimensional design spaces or systems with relatively simple dynamics.

Mallikarjunaiah,"A mathematical model for crack-tip fields is proposed in this paper for the response of a three-dimensional (3-D) porous elastic solid whose material moduli are dependent on the density. Such a description wherein the generalized Lam\`e coefficients are nonlinear functions of material stiffness is more realistic because most engineering materials are porous, and their material properties depend on porosity and density. The governing boundary value problem for the static equilibrium state in a 3-D, homogeneous, isotropic material is obtained as a second-order, quasilinear partial-differential-equation system with a classical traction-free crack-surface boundary condition. The numerical solution is obtained from a continuous trilinear Galerkin-type finite element discretization. A Picard-type linearization is utilized to handle the nonlinearities in the discrete problem. The proposed model can describe the state of stress and strain in various materials, including recovering the classical singularities in the linearized model. The role of \textit{tensile stress}, \textit{stress intensity factor} (SIF), and \textit{strain energy density} are examined. The results indicate that the maximum values of all these quantities occur directly before the crack-tip, consistent with the observation made in the canonical problem for the linearized elastic fracture mechanics.

The exact time integration algorithm for non-autonomous systems can be represented by an algorithmic function in higher dimensions, which satisfies an associated system of partial differential equations with corresponding boundary conditions. Our method learns the algorithmic function by solving this associated system using ELM with a physics informed approach. The trained ELM network serves as the learned algorithm and can be used to solve the IVP with arbitrary initial data or step sizes from some domain. When the right hand side of the non-autonomous system exhibits a periodicity with respect to any of its arguments, while the solution itself to the problem is not periodic, we show that the algorithmic function is either periodic, or when it is not, satisfies a well-defined relation for different periods. This property can greatly simplify the algorithm learning in many problems. We consider explicit and implicit NN formulations, leading to explicit or implicit time integration algorithms, and discuss how to train the ELM network by the nonlinear least squares method. Extensive numerical experiments with benchmark problems, including non-stiff, stiff and chaotic systems, show that the learned NN algorithm produces highly accurate solutions in long-time simulations, with its time-marching errors decreasing nearly exponentially with increasing degrees of freedom in the neural network.

A numerical spectral analysis is performed, showing that O(1)-stabilization is required to avoid excessive CFL limitations for explicit time discretizations. Moreover, the spectral radius of the stiffness matrix is fairly independent of the geometry of the mesh cells. For analytical solutions on general meshes, optimal convergence rates of order (k+1) are shown in both equal- and mixed-order settings using O(1)-stabilization, whereas order (k+2) is achieved in the mixed-order setting using O(1/h)-stabilization. Test cases with a Ricker wavelet as an initial condition showcase the relevance of the proposed method for the simulation of elasto-acoustic wave propagation across media with contrasted material properties.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.10850v1,Accelerating convergence of a natural convection solver by continuous data assimilation,Elizabeth Hawkins,"The Picard iteration for the Boussinesq model of natural convection can be an attractive solver because it stably decouples the fluid equations from the temperature equation (for contrast, the Newton iteration does not stably decouple). However, the convergence of Picard for this system is only linear and slows as the Rayleigh number increases, eventually failing for even moderately sized Rayleigh numbers. We consider this solver in the setting where sparse solution data is available, e.g. from data measurements or solution observables, and enhance Picard by incorporating the data into the iteration using a continuous data assimilation (CDA) approach. We prove that our approach scales the linear convergence rate by $H^{1/2}$, where $H$ is the characteristic spacing of the measurement locations. This implies that when Picard is converging, CDA will accelerate convergence, and when Picard is not converging, CDA (with enough data) will enable convergence. In the case of noisy data, we prove that the linear convergence rate of the nonlinear residual is similarly scaled by $H^{1/2}$ but the accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the data. Several numerical tests illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including when the data is noisy. These tests show that CDA style nudging adapted to an iteration (instead of a time stepping scheme) enables convergence at much higher $Ra$.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

2502.10665v1,b-d-Lawson: a method for the interpolation constrained rational minimax approximation,Lei-Hong Zhang; Ya-Nan Zhang,"In this paper, we propose a novel dual-based Lawson's method, termed b-d-Lawson, designed for addressing the rational minimax approximation under specific interpolation conditions. The b-d-Lawson approach incorporates two pivotal components that have been recently gained prominence in the realm of the rational approximations: the barycentric representation of the rational function and the dual framework for tackling minimax approximation challenges. The employment of barycentric formulae enables a streamlined parameterization of the rational function, ensuring natural satisfaction of interpolation conditions while mitigating numerical instability typically associated with Vandermonde basis matrices when monomial bases are utilized. This enhances both the accuracy and computational stability of the method. To address the bi-level min-max structure, the dual framework effectively transforms the challenge into a max-min dual problem, thereby facilitating the efficient application of Lawson's iteration. The integration of this dual perspective is crucial for optimizing the approximation process. We will discuss several applications of interpolation-constrained rational minimax approximation and illustrate numerical results to evaluate the performance of the b-d-Lawson method.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.10613v1,Function recovery and optimal sampling in the presence of nonuniform evaluation costs,Ben Adcock,"We consider recovering a function $f : D \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ in a $n$-dimensional linear subspace $\mathcal{P}$ from i.i.d. pointwise samples via (weighted) least-squares estimators. Different from most works, we assume the cost of evaluating $f$ is potentially nonuniform, and governed by a cost function $c : D \rightarrow (0,\infty)$ which may blow up at certain points. We therefore strive to choose the sampling measure in a way that minimizes the expected total cost. We provide a recovery guarantee which asserts accurate and stable recovery with an expected cost depending on the Christoffel function and Remez-type constant of the space $\mathcal{P}$. This leads to a general recipe for optimizing the sampling measure for general $c$. As an example, we consider one-dimensional polynomial spaces. Here, we provide two strategies for choosing the sampling measure, which we prove are optimal (up to constants and log factors) in the case of algebraically-growing cost functions.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.10600v1,Weighted quantization using MMD: From mean field to mean shift via gradient flows,Ayoub Belhadji; Daniel Sharp; Youssef Marzouk,"Approximating a probability distribution using a set of particles is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics, with applications including clustering and quantization. Formally, we seek a finite weighted mixture of Dirac measures that best approximates the target distribution. While much existing work relies on the Wasserstein distance to quantify approximation errors, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has received comparatively less attention, especially when allowing for variable particle weights. We study the quantization problem from the perspective of minimizing MMD via gradient flow in the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) geometry. This gradient flow yields an ODE system from which we further derive a fixed-point algorithm called mean shift interacting particles (MSIP). We show that MSIP extends the (non-interacting) mean shift algorithm, widely used for identifying modes in kernel density estimates. Moreover, we show that MSIP can be interpreted as preconditioned gradient descent, and that it acts as a relaxation of Lloyd's algorithm for clustering. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that MSIP and the WFR ODEs outperform other algorithms for quantization of multi-modal and high-dimensional targets.",NA,NA,0,1

In this work, we utilize 5 different numerical ODE solvers namely: Euler's method, Heun's method, Midpoint Method, Runge-kutta 4th order and ODE45 method in order to discover the answer of three wellknown case studies and compare their results by calculation of relative errors. To check for the validity of the estimations, the experimental data of previous literature have been compared with the data in this paper which shows a good accordance. We observe that for each of the case studies based on the behavior of the model, the estimation accuracy of the solvers is different. For the logistic population change as the first case study, the results of all solvers are so close to each other that only their solution cost can be considered for their superiority. For temperature change of a building as the second case study we see that in some especial areas the accuracy of the solvers is different and in general Midpoint ODE solver shows better results. As the last case study, market equilibrium price shows that none of the numerical ODE solvers can estimate its behavior which is due to its sudden changing nature.",NA,NA,0,1

It focuses on methods for data visualisation, multivariate statistics, and hypothesis testing. To investigate the expenditure behavior of tourist, spending patterns, correlations, and associations among variables were analysed in the dataset. The results revealed a significant relationship between accommodation type and the purpose of trip, showing that the purpose of a trip impacts the selection of accommodation. A strong correlation was observed between organizer expenditure and private expenditure, indicating that individual spending are more when the spending on organizing the trip are higher. However, no significant difference was observed in total expenditure across different accommodation types and purpose of the trip revealing that travelers tend to spend similar amounts regardless of their reason for travel or choice of accommodation. Although significant relationships were observed among certain variables, ANOVA could not be applied because the dataset was not able to hold on the normality assumption.

2502.10084v1,An adaptive importance sampling algorithm for risk-averse optimization,Sandra Pieraccini; Tommaso Vanzan,"Adaptive sampling algorithms are modern and efficient methods that dynamically adjust the sample size throughout the optimization process. However, they may encounter difficulties in risk-averse settings, particularly due to the challenge of accurately sampling from the tails of the underlying distribution of random inputs. This often leads to a much faster growth of the sample size compared to risk-neutral problems. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive sampling algorithm that adapts both the sample size and the sampling distribution at each iteration. The biasing distributions are constructed on the fly, leveraging a reduced-order model of the objective function to be minimized, and are designed to oversample a so-called risk region. As a result, a reduction of the variance of the gradients is achieved, which permits to use fewer samples per iteration compared to a standard algorithm, while still preserving the asymptotic convergence rate. Our focus is on the minimization of the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), and we establish the convergence of the proposed computational framework.

We will focus here on the resolution of two equations: the Poisson-Dirichlet equation and the non-linear elasticity equations. The key idea of our method is to address the challenging scenario of varying domains, where each problem is solved on a different geometry. The considered domains are defined by level-set functions due to the use of the Phi-FEM approach. We will first recall the idea of $\varphi$-FEM and of the Fourier Neural Operator.

Results going back over a century have shown that the majority of nonpolynomial nonlinear systems can be recast in polynomial form, and their degree can be reduced further to quadratic. This process of polynomialization/quadratization reveals new variables (in most cases, additional variables have to be added to achieve this) in which the system dynamics adhere to that specific form, which leads us to discover new structures of a model. This chapter summarizes the state of the art for the discovery of polynomial and quadratic representations of finite-dimensional dynamical systems.

The first of the two methods uses the computed factors from a singular value decomposition (SVD) to verify all singular values; the second estimates a lower bound of the minimum singular value without performing the SVD. The proposed approach for verifying all singular values efficiently computes tight error bounds. The method for estimating a lower bound of the minimum singular value is particularly effective for sparse matrices.

Any Toeplitz matrix can be transformed into a matrix with off-diagonal blocks that are of low numerical rank.Surprisingly little is known about the compressibility of these matrices in a theoretically rigorous sense, even though this compressibility is relied upon in practice in a number of superfast Toeplitz solvers. In this paper, we show that the compression properties of these matrices can be thoroughly explained using their displacement structure. We provide explicit bounds on the numerical ranks of important submatrices that arise when applying HSS, HODLR and other approximations with hierarchical low-rank structure to transformed Toeplitz and Toeplitz-like matrices.

We examine this problem from an approximation-theoretic perspective, focusing on least squares and deep learning-based methods. First, we establish a novel recovery theorem for least squares approximations using the Slepian basis from uniform random samples in low dimensions, explicitly tracking the dependence of the bandwidth on the sampling complexity. Building on these results, we then present a recovery guarantee for approximating bandlimited functions via deep learning from pointwise data. This result, framed as a practical existence theorem, provides conditions on the network architecture, training procedure, and data acquisition sufficient for accurate approximation. To complement our theoretical findings, we perform numerical comparisons between least squares and deep learning for approximating one- and two-dimensional functions.

To overcome this issue, we propose to use adaptive inexact bilevel optimization to solve ADP problems. We discuss an extension of a recent inexact bilevel method called the method of adaptive inexact descent of Salehi et al.(2024) to an infinite-dimensional setting required by the ADP framework. In our numerical experiments we demonstrate that the computational speed-up achieved by adaptive inexact bilevel optimization allows one to use ADP on larger-scale problems than in the previous literature, e.g. in deblurring of 2D color images.",NA,NA,0,1

In a DA context the use of adaptive spatial meshes addresses several factors that place increased demands on meshing; these include the location and relative importance of observations and the use of ensemble solutions. To increase the efficiency of adaptive meshes for data assimilation, robust look ahead meshes are developed that fix the same adaptive mesh for all ensemble members for the entire time interval of the forecasts and that incorporates the observations at the next analysis time. This allows for increased vectorization of the ensemble forecasts while minimizing interpolation of solutions between different meshes. The techniques to determine these robust meshes are based upon combining metric tensors or mesh density functions to define nonuniform meshes. We illustrate the robust ensemble look ahead meshes using traveling wave solutions of a bistable reaction-diffusion equation. Observation operators based on convolution type integrals and their associated metric tensors are derived. These further the goals of making efficient use of adaptive meshes in ensemble based DA techniques, developing and employing robust meshes that are effective for a range of similar behaviors in both the ensembles and the observations, and the integration with advanced numerical PDE techniques (a quasi-Lagrangian moving mesh DG technique employing embedded pairs for time stepping).

2502.09737v1,"Adjoint of Least Squares Shadowing: Existence, Uniqueness and Coarse Domain Discretization",Pranshul Thakur; Siva Nadarajah,"Chaotic dynamical systems are characterized by the sensitive dependence of trajectories on initial conditions. Conventional sensitivity analysis of time-averaged functionals yields unbounded sensitivities when the simulation is chaotic. The least squares shadowing (LSS) is a popular approach to computing bounded sensitivities in the presence of chaotic dynamical systems. The current paper proves the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of the adjoint of the LSS equations. In particular, the analysis yields a sharper bound on the condition number of the LSS equations than currently demonstrated in existing literature and shows that the condition number is bounded for large integration times. The derived bound on condition number also shows a relation between the conditioning of the LSS and the time dilation factor which is consistent with the trend numerically observed in the previous LSS literature. Furthermore, using the boundedness of the condition number for large integration times, we provide an alternate proof to (Chater et al., 2017) of the convergence of the LSS sensitivity to the true sensitivity at the rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}\right)$ regardless of the boundary conditions imposed on the adjoint, as long as the adjoint boundary conditions are bounded. Existence and uniqueness of the solution to the continuous-in-time adjoint LSS equation ensure that the LSS equation can be discretized independently of the primal equation and that the true LSS adjoint solution is recovered as the time step is refined. This allows for the adjoint LSS equation to be discretized on a coarser time domain than that of the primal governing equation to reduce the cost of solving the linear space-time system.",NA,NA,0,1

We examine a broad class of slip boundary conditions that generalises the commonly used Navier slip, perfect slip, stick-slip and Tresca friction boundary conditions. In particular, set-valued, non-monotone, noncoercive and dynamic relations may occur. For a unifying framework of such relations, we present a fully discrete numerical scheme for the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations subject to impermeability and general slip type boundary conditions on polyhedral domains. Based on compactness arguments, we prove convergence of subsequences, finally ensuring the existence of a weak solution. The numerical scheme uses a general inf-sup stable pair of finite element spaces for the velocity and pressure, a regularisation approach for the implicit slip boundary condition and, most importantly, a Nitsche method to impose the impermeability and a backward Euler time stepping.

The resulting scheme is decoupled, energy-preserving, and exhibits greater flexibility. For the Klein-Gordon-Schr\""odinger equations, we apply the dual-partition AVF method and construct fully explicit energy-preserving schemes with pointwise decoupling, where the computational complexity per time step is $\mathcal{O}(N^d)$, with $d$ representing the problem dimension and $N$ representing the number of grid points in each direction.

2502.09413v2,Analysis of harmonic average method for interface problems with discontinuous solutions and fluxes,Kejia Pan; Hengrui Xu; Zhilin Li,"Harmonic average method has been widely utilized to deal with heterogeneous coefficients in solving differential equations. One remarkable advantage of the harmonic averaging method is that no derivative of the coefficient is needed. Furthermore, the coefficient matrix of the finite difference equations is an M-matrix which guarantees the stability of the algorithm. It has been numerically observed but not theoretically proved that the method produces second order pointwise accuracy when the solution and flux are continuous even if the coefficient has finite discontinuities for which the method is inconsistent ($O(1)$ in the local truncation errors). It has been believed that there are some fortunate error cancellations. The harmonic average method does not converge when the solution or the flux has finite discontinuities. In this paper, not only we rigorously prove the second order convergence of the harmonic averaging method for one-dimensional interface problem when the coefficient has a finite discontinuities and the solution and the flux are continuous, but also proposed an {\em improved harmonic average method} that is also second order accurate (in the $L^{\infty}$ norm), which allows discontinuous solutions and fluxes along with the discontinuous coefficients.

These achieved exponential error reduction for Burgers equation) by combining Taylor expansions with Chebyshev derivatives in overlap regions. While Chebfun splitting strategy automates domain decomposition, it enforces only C0 continuity, leading to discontinuous higher derivatives. In contrast, the proposed algorithms preserved smoothness up to CN continuity, critical for eigenvalue problems in hydrodynamic stability and nonlinear BVPs. Validation on 3D channel flow with viscosity stratification and Burgers equation highlighted the methods robustness. For instance, eigenvalue calculations for miscible core-annular flows matched prior results while resolving sharp viscosity gradients with fewer nodes.",NA,NA,0,1

They have been shown to be effective in solving problems with periodic boundary conditions. However, in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions, order reduction has been observed even with homogeneous boundary conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel splitting approach, the so-called `initial-corrected splitting method', which succeeds in overcoming order reduction. A convergence analysis is performed to demonstrate second-order convergence of this modified Strang splitting method. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the newly developed splitting approach.",NA,NA,0,1

Three different finite element discretization schemes are proposed, and a priori error estimates are proven under appropriate regularity assumptions for each one. A key contribution of this paper is the development of residual-based a posteriori error estimators for both fully discrete and semi-discrete schemes, guiding adaptive mesh refinement to achieve comparable accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom. The method of manufactured solutions is used for numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings, to demonstrate optimal convergence rates and the effectivity index is evaluated to measure their reliability.

In this context, the iterates are vectors generated from a fixed-point mapping function. However, when considering the iterative solution of large-scale matrix equations, the iterates are low-rank matrices generated from a fixed-point process for which, generally, the mapping function changes in each iteration. To enable acceleration of the iterative solution for these problems, we propose two novel generalizations of RRE. First, we show how to effectively compute RRE for sequences of low-rank matrices. Second, we derive a formulation of RRE that is suitable for fixed-point processes for which the mapping function changes each iteration. We demonstrate the potential of the methods on several numerical examples involving the iterative solution of large-scale Lyapunov and Riccati matrix equations.",NA,NA,0,1

Geometric and polynomial coarsening of the space-time mesh is performed, and the entire algorithm is expressed through rigorous mathematical mappings. For the discretization, we use inf-sup stable pairs $\mathbb Q_{r+1}/\mathbb P_{r}^{\text{disc}}$ of elements in space and a discontinuous Galerkin (DG$(k)$) discretization in time with piecewise polynomials of order $k$. The key novelty of this work is the application of $hp$ multigrid techniques in space and time, facilitated and accelerated by the matrix-free capabilities of the deal.II library. While multigrid methods are well-established for stationary problems, their application in space-time formulations encounter unique challenges, particularly in constructing suitable smoothers. To overcome these challenges, we employ a space-time cell-wise Vanka smoother.

Elsayed; Yousef Heider; Oliver Weeger,"This study introduces a physics-based machine learning framework for modeling both brittle and ductile fractures. Unlike physics-informed neural networks, which solve partial differential equations by embedding physical laws as soft constraints in loss functions and enforcing boundary conditions via collocation points, our framework integrates physical principles, such as the governing equations and constraints, directly into the neural network architecture. This approach eliminates the dependency on problem-specific retraining for new boundary value problems, ensuring adaptability and consistency. By embedding constitutive behavior into the network's foundational design, our method represents a significant step toward unifying material modeling with machine learning for computational fracture mechanics. Specifically, a feedforward neural network is designed to embed physical laws within its architecture, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Building on this foundation, synthetic datasets generated from finite element-based phase-field simulations are employed to train the proposed framework, focusing on capturing the homogeneous responses of brittle and ductile fractures. Detailed analyses are performed on the stored elastic energy and the dissipated work due to plasticity and fracture, demonstrating the capability of the framework to predict essential fracture features. The proposed physics-based machine learning framework overcomes the shortcomings of classical machine learning models, which rely heavily on large datasets and lack guarantees of physical principles. By leveraging its physics-integrated design, the physics-based machine learning framework demonstrates exceptional performance in predicting key properties of brittle and ductile fractures with limited training data.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.08998v1,Generic Structural Stability for $2 \times 2$ Systems of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws,Hong Kiat Tan; Andrea L. Bertozzi,"This paper presents a proof of generic structural stability for Riemann solutions to $2 \times 2$ system of hyperbolic conservation laws in one spatial variable, without diffusive terms. This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curve, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to illustrate the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then illustrate the applications of this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2502.08951v1,Asymptotic-Preserving Dynamical Low-Rank Method for the Stiff Nonlinear Boltzmann Equation,Lukas Einkemmer; Jingwei Hu; Shiheng Zhang,"In kinetic theory, numerically solving the full Boltzmann equation is extremely expensive. This is because the Boltzmann collision operator involves a high-dimensional, nonlinear integral that must be evaluated at each spatial grid point and every time step. The challenge becomes even more pronounced in the fluid (strong collisionality) regime, where the collision operator exhibits strong stiffness, causing explicit time integrators to impose severe stability restrictions. In this paper, we propose addressing this problem through a dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation. The resulting algorithm requires evaluating the Boltzmann collision operator only $r^2$ times, where $r$, the rank of the approximation, is much smaller than the number of spatial grid points. We propose a novel DLR integrator, called the XL integrator, which reduces the number of steps compared to the available alternatives (such as the projector splitting or basis update & Galerkin (BUG) integrator). For a class of problems including the Boltzmann collision operator which enjoys a separation property between physical and velocity space, we further propose a specialized version of the XL integrator, called the sXL integrator. This version requires solving only one differential equation to update the low-rank factors. Furthermore, the proposed low-rank schemes are asymptotic-preserving, meaning they can capture the asymptotic fluid limit in the case of strong collisionality. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods across a wide range of regimes, from non-stiff (kinetic) to stiff (fluid).",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2502.08783v1,Learning Discontinuous Galerkin Solutions to Elliptic Problems via Small Linear Convolutional Neural Networks,Adrian Celaya; Yimo Wang; David Fuentes; Beatrice Riviere,"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using deep learning and neural networks to tackle scientific problems, particularly in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, many neural network-based methods, such as physics-informed neural networks, depend on automatic differentiation and the sampling of collocation points, which can result in a lack of interpretability and lower accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods. To address this issue, we propose two approaches for learning discontinuous Galerkin solutions to PDEs using small linear convolutional neural networks. Our first approach is supervised and depends on labeled data, while our second approach is unsupervised and does not rely on any training data. In both cases, our methods use substantially fewer parameters than similar numerics-based neural networks while also demonstrating comparable accuracy to the true and DG solutions for elliptic problems.",NA,NA,0,1

The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstructions are absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has a nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalizations. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.",NA,NA,0,1

Reiter,"We present a continuous and a discontinuous linear Finite Element method based on a predictor-corrector scheme for the numerical approximation of the Ericksen-Leslie equations, a model for nematic liquid crystal flow including a non-convex unit-sphere constraint. As predictor step we propose a linear semi-implicit Finite Element discretization which naturally offers a local orthogonality relation between the approximate director field and its time derivative. Afterwards an explicit discrete projection onto the unit-sphere constraint is applied without increasing the modeled energy. For the Finite Element approximation of the director field, we compare the usage of a discrete inner product, usually referred to as mass-lumping, for a globally continuous, piecewise linear discretization to a piecewise constant, discontinuous Galerkin approach. Discrete well-posedness results and energy laws are established. Conditional convergence of the approximate solutions to energy-variational solutions of the Ericksen-Leslie equations is shown for a time-step restriction, see Theorems 1 and 2.

These systems leverage the relatively stable underground temperature to regulate indoor climates, reducing reliance on conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This review systematically categorizes and synthesizes research on EAHEs into three primary areas: analytical, numerical, and exergoeconomic studies. Analytical approaches focus on developing theoretical models to predict thermal performance, while numerical simulations provide insights into system optimization and real-world applications. Exergoeconomic analyses, integrating thermodynamic efficiency with economic considerations, offer valuable perspectives on cost-effectiveness and long-term viability. By consolidating existing contributions across these domains, this study serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers seeking to enhance the design, implementation, and performance of EAHE systems. The findings emphasize the pivotal role of EAHEs in reducing energy consumption, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improving economic sustainability. Additionally, this review identifies key challenges, including soil thermal conductivity variations, moisture effects, and system integration with renewable energy sources, which require further investigation.

In the paper ""The Signature Kernel is the solution of a Goursat PDE"", the authors identify a kernel trick that demonstrates that, for continuously differentiable paths, the signature kernel satisfies a Goursat problem for a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) in two independent time variables. While finite difference methods have been explored for this PDE, they face limitations in accuracy and stability when handling highly oscillatory inputs. In this work, we introduce two advanced numerical schemes that leverage polynomial representations of boundary conditions through either approximation or interpolation techniques, and rigorously establish the theoretical convergence of the polynomial approximation scheme. Experimental evaluations reveal that our approaches yield improvements of several orders of magnitude in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to traditional finite difference schemes, without increasing computational complexity. Furthermore, like finite difference methods, our algorithms can be GPU-parallelized to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear in the length of the input sequences, thereby improving scalability for high-frequency data.

To achieve this, we establish a dynamical low-rank approximation for the solutions of these dynamical systems by successively enriching each term in the reduced basis functions via a greedy algorithm. This enables us to reformulate the problem to two decoupled evolution equations at each enrichment step, of which one is a parameter-independent partial differential equation and the other one is a parameter-dependent ordinary differential equation. These equations are directly derived from the original dynamical system and the previously separate representation terms. Moreover, the computational process of the proposed method can be split into an offline stage, in which the reduced basis functions are constructed, and an online stage, in which the efficient low-rank representation of the solution is employed. The proposed dynamical Variable-separation method is capable of offering reduced computational complexity and enhanced efficiency compared to many existing low-rank separation techniques.

In the framework of evolutionary problems, space-time parallel methods offer the possibility to optimize parallelization. In the present paper, we propose a new family of these methods, built as a combination of the well-known parareal algorithm and suitable splitting techniques which permit us to parallelize in space. In particular, dimensional and domain decomposition splittings are considered for partitioning the elliptic operator, and first-order splitting time integrators are chosen as the propagators of the parareal algorithm to solve the resulting split problem. The major contribution of these methods is that, not only does the fine propagator perform in parallel, but also the coarse propagator. Unlike the classical version of the parareal algorithm, where all processors remain idle during the coarse propagator computations, the newly proposed schemes utilize the computational cores for both integrators.

In order to enhance image quality by exploiting nonlinear effects, recently techniques such as harmonic imaging and nonlinearity parameter tomography have been put forward. As soon as the pressure amplitude exceeds a certain bound, the classical linear wave equation loses its validity and more general nonlinear versions have to be used. Another characteristic property of ultrasound propagation in human tissue is frequency power law attenuation, leading to fractional derivative damping models in time domain. In this contribution we will first of all dwell on modeling nonlinearity on the one hand and fractional damping on the other hand. Moreover we will give an idea on the challenges in the analysis of the resulting PDEs and discuss some parameter asymptotics.

2502.08043v1,Finite difference alternative WENO schemes with Riemann invariant-based local characteristic decompositions for compressible Euler equations,Yue Wu; Chi-Wang Shu,"The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are widely used for hyperbolic conservation laws due to the ability to resolve discontinuities and maintain high-order accuracy in smooth regions at the same time. For hyperbolic systems, the WENO procedure is usually performed on local characteristic variables that are obtained by local characteristic decompositions to avoid oscillation near shocks. However, such decompositions are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we study a Riemann invariant-based local characteristic decomposition for the compressible Euler equations that reduces the cost. We apply the WENO procedure to the local characteristic fields of the Riemann invariants, where the eigenmatrix is sparse and thus the computational cost can be reduced. It is difficult to obtain the cell averages of Riemann invariants from those of the conserved variables due to the nonlinear relation between them, so we only focus on the finite difference alternative WENO versions.

We prove exponential lower bounds on the number of queries needed to estimate various properties, including the trace and the top eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}$. Our proofs hold for all adaptive algorithms, modulo a mild conditioning assumption on the algorithm's queries. We further prove that algorithms whose queries come from a small alphabet (e.g., $\mathrm{x}_i \in \{\pm1\}^n$) cannot test if $\mathbf{A}$ is identically zero with polynomial complexity, despite the fact that a single query using Gaussian vectors solves the problem with probability 1. In steep contrast to the non-Kronecker case, this shows that sketching $\mathbf{A}$ with different distributions of the same subguassian norm can yield exponentially different query complexities.

A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the Filtered Finite State Projection (D'Ambrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator.

We present and analyze a complex variant of the Gaussian mechanism and obtain upper bounds on the Frobenius norm of the difference between the matrix output by this mechanism and the best rank-$k$ approximation to $M$. Our analysis provides improvements over previous bounds, particularly when the spectrum of $M$ satisfies natural structural assumptions. The novel insight is to view the addition of Gaussian noise to a matrix as a continuous-time matrix Brownian motion. This viewpoint allows us to track the evolution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, which are governed by stochastic differential equations discovered by Dyson. These equations enable us to upper bound the Frobenius distance between the best rank-$k$ approximation of $M$ and that of a Gaussian perturbation of $M$ as an integral that involves inverse eigenvalue gaps of the stochastically evolving matrix, as opposed to a sum of perturbation bounds obtained via Davis-Kahan-type theorems. Subsequently, again using the Dyson Brownian motion viewpoint, we show that the eigenvalues of the matrix $M$ perturbed by Gaussian noise have large gaps with high probability. These results also contribute to the analysis of low-rank approximations under average-case perturbations, and to an understanding of eigenvalue gaps for random matrices, both of which may be of independent interest.",NA,NA,0,1

We construct multiscale basis functions by solving optimization problems and rigorously analyze two time-splitting MsFEMs for the semiclassical NLSE with random potentials. We provide the $L^2$ error estimate of the proposed methods and show that they achieve second-order accuracy in both spatial and temporal spaces and an almost first-order convergence rate in the random space. Additionally, we present a multiscale reduced basis method to reduce the computational cost of constructing basis functions for solving random NLSEs.

2502.07558v1,Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States,Anton Savostianov; Michael T. Schaub; Nicola Guglielmi; Francesco Tudisco,"Simplicial complexes (SCs), a generalization of graph models for relational data that account for higher-order relations between data items, have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets leads to dense SCs with a large number of higher-order interactions. Unfortunately, analyzing such large SCs often has a prohibitive cost in terms of computation time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser simplicial complex with only a log-linear number of high-order simplices while maintaining a spectrum close to the original SC, is of broad interest.   In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsifaction of SCs. At its core lies the efficient computation of sparsifying sampling probability through local densities of states as functional descriptors of the spectral information. To avoid pathological structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a ""kernel-ignoring"" decomposition for approximating the sampling probability; additionally, we exploit error estimates to show asymptotically prevailing algorithmic complexity of the developed method. The performance of the framework is demonstrated on the family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.",NA,NA,0,1

To avoid the time step restriction induced by the convection term, we adopt the semi-Lagrangian approach. For treating the nonlinear stiff relaxation operator with small Knudsen number, we employ high order $L$-stable diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta time discretization or backward difference formula. The proposed implicit schemes are designed to update solutions explicitly without resorting to any Newton solver.

Chen, Z. Sun, and Y. Xing, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 46: A1327-A1351, 2024], are a variant of RKDG methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws and are characterized by their compact stencil including only immediate neighboring finite elements. This article proposes a cRK Flux Reconstruction (FR) method by interpreting cRK as a procedure to approximate time-averaged fluxes, which requires computing only a single numerical flux for each time step and further reduces data communication. The numerical flux is carefully constructed to maintain the same Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers as cRKDG methods and achieve optimal accuracy uniformly across all polynomial degrees, even for problems with sonic points. A subcell-based blending limiter is then applied for problems with nonsmooth solutions, which uses Gauss-Legendre solution points and performs MUSCL-Hancock reconstruction on subcells to mitigate the additional dissipation errors. Additionally, to achieve a fully admissibility-preserving cRKFR scheme, a flux limiter is applied to the time-averaged numerical flux to ensure admissibility preservation in the means, combined with a positivity-preserving scaling limiter. The method is further extended to handle source terms by incorporating their contributions as additional time averages. Numerical experiments including Euler equations and the ten-moment problem are provided to validate the claims regarding the method's accuracy, robustness, and admissibility preservation.",NA,NA,0,1

In particular, we consider a generalized version of a transport equation with additional growth and non-local interaction terms in the space of nonnegative Radon measures equipped with the flat metric. The solutions, given by families of Radon measures, are approximated by linear combinations of Dirac measures. For this purpose, we introduce a finite-range approximation of the measure-valued model functions, provided that they are linear. By applying an operator splitting technique, we are able to separate the effects of the transport from those of growth and the non-local interaction. We derive the order of convergence of the numerical scheme, which is linear in the spatial discretization parameters and polynomial of order $\alpha$ in the time step size, assuming that the model functions are $\alpha$ H\""older regular in time.

The main innovation of CTL-PINN lies in decomposing long-term problems into a sequence of short-term subproblems. Initially, the standard PINN is employed to solve the first sub-problem. As the simulation progresses, subsequent time-domain problems are addressed using a curriculum learning approach that integrates information from previous steps. Furthermore, transfer learning techniques are incorporated, allowing the model to effectively utilize prior training data and solve sequential time domain transfer problems. CTL-PINN combines the strengths of curriculum learning and transfer learning, overcoming the limitations of standard PINNs, such as local optimization issues, and addressing the inaccuracies over extended time domains encountered in CL-PINN and the low computational efficiency of TL-PINN. The efficacy and robustness of CTL-PINN are demonstrated through applications to nonlinear wave propagation, Kirchhoff plate dynamic response, and the hydrodynamic model of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, showcasing its superior capability in addressing long-term computational challenges.",NA,NA,0,1

This paper explores a further avenue for reducing cost and improving power efficiency through the use of low precision calculations on configurable hardware devices such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We propose a new framework that exploits approximate random variables and fixed-point operations with optimised precision to generate most SDE paths with a lower cost and reduce the overall cost of the MLMC framework. We first discuss several methods for the cheap generation of approximate random Normal increments.

In this paper, we study an online sketched Newton method that leverages a randomized sketching technique to perform an approximate Newton step in each iteration, thereby eliminating the computational bottleneck of second-order methods. While existing studies have established the asymptotic normality of sketched Newton methods, a consistent estimator of the limiting covariance matrix remains an open problem. We propose a fully online covariance matrix estimator that is constructed entirely from the Newton iterates and requires no matrix factorization. Compared to covariance estimators for first-order online methods, our estimator for second-order methods is batch-free. We establish the consistency and convergence rate of our estimator, and coupled with asymptotic normality results, we can then perform online statistical inference for the model parameters based on sketched Newton methods. We also discuss the extension of our estimator to constrained problems, and demonstrate its superior performance on regression problems as well as benchmark problems in the CUTEst set.",NA,NA,0,1

Our methodology provides approximations of the transition density, easily evaluated via any software that performs symbolic calculations. A major part of the paper is devoted to an analytical control of the remainder in our expansion for fixed $\Delta\in(0,1)$. The obtained error bounds validate theoretically the methodology, by characterising the size of the distance from the true value. It is the first time that such a closed-form expansion becomes available for the important class of hypo-elliptic SDEs, to the best of our knowledge. For elliptic SDEs, closed-form expansions are available, with some works identifying the size of the error for fixed $\Delta$, as per our contribution. Our methodology allows for a uniform treatment of elliptic and hypo-elliptic SDEs, when earlier works are intrinsically restricted to an elliptic setting. We show numerical applications highlighting the effectiveness of our method, by carrying out parameter inference for hypo-elliptic SDEs that do not satisfy stated conditions.

These dynamical low-rank integrators are high-order extensions of the BUG integrator and are constructed by performing one time-step of the first-order BUG integrator at each stage of the Runge-Kutta method. In this way, the resulting Runge-Kutta BUG integrator is robust to the presence of small singular values and does not involve backward time-integration steps. We provide an error bound, which shows that the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator retains the order of convergence of the associated Runge-Kutta method until the error reaches a plateau corresponding to the low-rank truncation and which vanishes as the rank increases. This error bound is finally validated numerically on three different test cases.

We show that NeuMaps offer two key advantages: (1) they provide a computationally efficient embedding that accurately recovers the diffusion distance associated with the reflecting random walk on the subgraph, and (2) they naturally incorporate the Nystr\""om extension within the diffusion map framework through the discrete Neumann boundary condition. Through examples in digit classification and molecular dynamics, we demonstrate that NeuMaps not only improve upon existing landmark-based embedding methods but also enhance the stability of diffusion map embeddings to the removal of highly significant points.",NA,NA,0,1

Further, we present a numerical study showing that the hybrid Schwarz preconditioner dominates the additive one from the point of view of the speed of convergence and also computational costs. Finally, the combination with a $hp$-mesh adaptation for the solution of nonlinear problem demonstrates the potential of this approach.",NA,NA,0,1

The matrix is first partitioned into blocks, and an iterative process using block matrix inversion is repeated until the matrix approximation reaches a satisfactory level of accuracy.

These use cases benefit significantly from the ultra-high data rates, low latency, and high spatial resolution offered by THz frequencies. However, a primary well-known challenge of THz networks is their limited coverage range due to high path loss and vulnerability to obstructions.

The problem is reformulated as an optimization problem using Tikhonov regularization. A space-time interface-fitted method is employed to discretize the advection-diffusion equation, where two second-order a priori error estimates are established with respect to the $L^2$-norms. Additionally, the regularized source is discretized sequentially using the variational approach, the element-wise constant discretization, and finally, the post-processing strategy. Optimal error estimates are achieved for the first two methods, while superlinear convergence is obtained for the third. Furthermore, a priori choices for the regularization parameter are proposed, depending on the mesh size and noise level. These choices ensure that the discrete and post-processing solutions strongly converge to the exact source as the mesh size and noise level tend to zero.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

Osher; Hayden Schaeffer,"Neural networks are one tool for approximating non-linear differential equations used in scientific computing tasks such as surrogate modeling, real-time predictions, and optimal control. PDE foundation models utilize neural networks to train approximations to multiple differential equations simultaneously and are thus a general purpose solver that can be adapted to downstream tasks. Current PDE foundation models focus on either learning general solution operators and/or the governing system of equations, and thus only handle numerical or symbolic modalities. However, real-world applications may require more flexible data modalities, e.g. text analysis or descriptive outputs. To address this gap, we propose a novel multimodal deep learning approach that leverages a transformer-based architecture to approximate solution operators for a wide variety of ODEs and PDEs. Our method integrates numerical inputs, such as equation parameters and initial conditions, with text descriptions of physical processes or system dynamics. This enables our model to handle settings where symbolic representations may be incomplete or unavailable. In addition to providing accurate numerical predictions, our approach generates interpretable scientific text descriptions, offering deeper insights into the underlying dynamics and solution properties. The numerical experiments show that our model provides accurate solutions for in-distribution data (with average relative error less than 3.3%) and out-of-distribution data (average relative error less than 7.8%) together with precise text descriptions (with correct descriptions generated 100% of times).

2502.05703v1,Subspace Splitting Fast Sampling from Gaussian Posterior Distributions of Linear Inverse Problems,Daniela Calvetti; Erkki Somersalo,"It is well-known that the posterior density of linear inverse problems with Gaussian prior and Gaussian likelihood is also Gaussian, hence completely described by its covariance and expectation. Sampling from a Gaussian posterior may be important in the analysis of various non-Gaussian inverse problems in which a estimates from a Gaussian posterior distribution constitute an intermediate stage in a Bayesian workflow. Sampling from a Gaussian distribution is straightforward if the Cholesky factorization of the covariance matrix or its inverse is available, however when the unknown is high dimensional, the computation of the posterior covariance maybe unfeasible. If the linear inverse problem is underdetermined, it is possible to exploit the orthogonality of the fundamental subspaces associated with the coefficient matrix together with the idea behind the Randomize-Then-Optimize approach to design a low complexity posterior sampler that does not require the posterior covariance to be formed.

These include variational integrators as an important subclass of geometric integrators. The general idea for those variational integrators is to discretize Hamilton's principle rather than the equations of motion and as a consequence these methods preserves some of the invariants of the original system (symplecticity, symmetry, good behavior of energy,...). In this paper, we construct variational integrators for control-dependent Lagrangian systems on Lie groups.

We first express the error by an iterated application of the Duhamel principle, followed by quadratures of Birkhoff-Hermite type of the underlying multivariate integrals. This leads to error estimates and bounds, derived using Peano/Sard kernels and direct estimates of the leading error term.

2502.05463v1,Learning Memory and Material Dependent Constitutive Laws,Kaushik Bhattacharya; Lianghao Cao; George Stepaniants; Andrew Stuart; Margaret Trautner,"The theory of homogenization provides a systematic approach to the derivation of macroscale constitutive laws, obviating the need to repeatedly resolve complex microstructure. However, the unit cell problem that defines the constitutive model is typically not amenable to explicit evaluation. It is therefore of interest to learn constitutive models from data generated by the unit cell problem. Many viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic materials are characterized by memory-dependent constitutive laws. In order to amortize the computational investment in finding such memory-dependent constitutive laws, it is desirable to learn their dependence on the material microstructure. While prior work has addressed learning memory dependence and material dependence separately, their joint learning has not been considered. This paper focuses on the joint learning problem and proposes a novel neural operator framework to address it.   In order to provide firm foundations, the homogenization problem for linear Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic materials is studied. The theoretical properties of the cell problem in this Kelvin-Voigt setting are used to motivate the proposed general neural operator framework; these theoretical properties are also used to prove a universal approximation theorem for the learned macroscale constitutive model. This formulation of learnable constitutive models is then deployed beyond the Kelvin-Voigt setting. Numerical experiments are presented showing that the resulting data-driven methodology accurately learns history- and microstructure-dependent linear viscoelastic and nonlinear elastoviscoplastic constitutive models, and numerical results also demonstrate that the resulting constitutive models can be deployed in macroscale simulation of material deformation.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

The main challenge in correctly computing the projection is to guarantee the topological correctness of crossings in the projection. Our approach combines certified path tracking and interval arithmetic in a two-step procedure: first, we construct an approximation to the curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and, second, we refine the approximation until the topological correctness of the projection can be guaranteed.

This is of particular interest when analyzing cyclostationary data, whose cyclic structure is not exploited by the standard PCA algorithm. We first formulate QPCA as an optimization problem, which we show may be decomposed into a series of PCA problems in the frequency domain. We then formalize our solution as an explicit algorithm and analyze its computational complexity. Finally, we provide some examples of applications of QPCA to cyclostationary signal processing data, including an investigation of carrier pulse recovery, a presentation of methods for estimating an unknown oversampling rate, and a discussion of an appropriate approach for pre-processing data with a non-integer oversampling rate in order to better apply the QPCA algorithm.",NA,NA,0,1

Olson; Matthew West,"Legacy codes are in ubiquitous use in scientific simulations; they are well-tested and there is significant time investment in their use. However, one challenge is the adoption of new, sometimes incompatible computing paradigms, such as GPU hardware. In this paper, we explore using automated code translation to enable execution of legacy multigrid solver code on GPUs without significant time investment and while avoiding intrusive changes to the codebase. We developed a thin, reusable translation layer that parses Fortran 2003 at compile time, interfacing with the existing library Loopy to transpile to C++/GPU code, which is then managed by a custom MPI runtime system that we created. With this low-effort approach, we are able to achieve a payoff of an approximately 2-3x speedup over a full CPU socket, and 6x in multi-node settings.",NA,NA,0,1

Cruz Alegría; Ken Trotti; Alena Kopaničáková; Rolf Krause,"Parallel training methods are increasingly relevant in machine learning (ML) due to the continuing growth in model and dataset sizes. We propose a variant of the Additively Preconditioned Trust-Region Strategy (APTS) for training deep neural networks (DNNs). The proposed APTS method utilizes a data-parallel approach to construct a nonlinear preconditioner employed in the nonlinear optimization strategy. In contrast to the common employment of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), which are both variants of gradient descent (GD) algorithms, the APTS method implicitly adjusts the step sizes in each iteration, thereby removing the need for costly hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed APTS variant using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results obtained indicate that the APTS variant proposed here achieves comparable validation accuracy to SGD and Adam, all while allowing for parallel training and obviating the need for expensive hyperparameter tuning.",NA,NA,0,1

The degrees of freedom of this method are cell averages, as in finite volume methods, and in addition shared point values at the cell interfaces, giving rise to a globally continuous reconstruction. Its classical version was introduced as a one-stage fully discrete, third-order method. Recently, a semi-discrete version of the Active Flux method was presented with various extensions to arbitrarily high order in one space dimension. In this paper we extend the semi-discrete Active Flux method on two-dimensional Cartesian grids to arbitrarily high order, by including moments as additional degrees of freedom (hybrid finite element--finite volume method). The stability of this method is studied for linear advection. For a fully discrete version, using an explicit Runge-Kutta method, a CFL restriction is derived.

Quantum computing is known to provide a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods for mean estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar quadratic speedup is achievable for estimating $\textit{non-linear}$ functionals of probability distributions. We propose a quantum-inside-quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves such a speedup for a broad class of non-linear estimation problems, including nested conditional expectations and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm improves upon the direct application of the quantum multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by An et al.. The existing lower bound indicates that our algorithm is optimal up polylogarithmic factors.

We propose a nonlinear approximation method where $M_n $ is defined as the range of a smooth nonlinear decoder $D$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with values in a possibly high-dimensional linear space $X_N$, and a linear encoder $E$ which associates to an element from $ M$ its coefficients $E(u)$ on a basis of a $n$-dimensional subspace $X_n \subset X_N$, where $X_n$ and $X_N$ are optimal or near to optimal linear spaces, depending on the selected error measure. The linearity of the encoder allows to easily obtain the parameters $E(u)$ associated with a given element $u$ in $M$. The proposed decoder is a polynomial map from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $X_N$ which is obtained by a tree-structured composition of polynomial maps, estimated sequentially from samples in $M$. Rigorous error and stability analyses are provided, as well as an adaptive strategy for constructing a decoder that guarantees an approximation of the set $M$ with controlled mean-squared or wort-case errors, and a controlled stability (Lipschitz continuity) of the encoder and decoder pair.

Lee; Qi Lei,"Weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization is a type of finetuning (FT) where a strong (large) student model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by a weak teacher. Surprisingly, W2S FT often outperforms the weak teacher. We seek to understand this phenomenon through the observation that FT often occurs in intrinsically low-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of FT, we analyze W2S in the ridgeless regression setting from a variance reduction perspective. For a strong student - weak teacher pair with sufficiently expressive low-dimensional feature subspaces $\mathcal{V}_s, \mathcal{V}_w$, we provide an exact characterization of the variance that dominates the generalization error of W2S. This unveils a virtue of discrepancy between the strong and weak models in W2S: the variance of the weak teacher is inherited by the strong student in $\mathcal{V}_s \cap \mathcal{V}_w$, while reduced by a factor of $\dim(\mathcal{V}_s)/N$ in the subspace of discrepancy $\mathcal{V}_w \setminus \mathcal{V}_s$ with $N$ pseudo-labels for W2S. Further, our analysis casts light on the sample complexities and the scaling of performance gap recovery in W2S.

Assuming smoothness for the interface between the subdomains and regularity of the data, the electric field solution of the Maxwell equations possesses an asymptotic expansion in powers of the parameter $\eps=1/ \sqrt{\mu_{r}}$ with profile terms rapidly decaying inside the magnetic conductor. We make explicit the first terms of this expansion. As an application of the asymptotic expansion we obtain the asymptotic behavior of a skin depth function that allows to measure the boundary layer phenomenon at large relative permeability. As another application of this expansion we give elements of proof for the derivation of impedance boundary conditions (IBCs) up to the third order of approximation with respect to the parameter $\varepsilon$, and we prove error estimates for the IBCs.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

Indeed, in recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become particularly interesting for rapidly solving such problems, especially in high dimensions. However, their lack of accuracy is a significant drawback in this context, hence the interest in combining them with FEM, for which error estimators are already known. The complete pipeline proposed here, therefore, consists of modifying classical FEM approximation spaces by taking information from a prior, chosen here as the prediction of a neural network. On the one hand, this combination improves and certifies the prediction of neural networks to obtain a fast and accurate solution. On the other hand, error estimates are proven, showing that such strategies outperform classical ones by a factor that depends only on the quality of the prior. We validate our approach with numerical results obtained for this preliminary work on parametric problems with one- and two-dimensional geometries. They demonstrate that to achieve a fixed error target, a coarser mesh can be used with our enhanced FEM compared to the standard one, leading to reduced computation time, particularly for parametric problems.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

In this paper, we developed a finite volume element method (FVEM) with the Gauss-Seidel projection method (GSPM) for the micromagnetics simulations. We give the error estimate for FVEM in space and depict the discretized energy dissipation. Owing to the application of the GSPM, the nonlinear vector system is decoupled and the computational complexity is comparable to that of implicitly solving the scalar heat equation, which accelerates the real simulations significantly.

The resulting hybrid format has one tensor train for each spatial cell and each time step. We adapt a MUSCL scheme to this hybrid format and show the feasibility of the approach using several classical test cases. A convergence study is done on the Burgers' equation with three stochastic parameters.

The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization.

There are two types of data-driven ROM closures in current use: (i) structural, with simple ansatzes (e.g., linear or quadratic); and (ii) machine learning-based, with neural network ansatzes. We propose a novel symbolic regression (SR) data-driven ROM closure strategy, which combines the advantages of current approaches and eliminates their drawbacks. As a result, the new data-driven SR closures yield ROMs that are interpretable, parsimonious, accurate, generalizable, and robust. To compare the data-driven SR-ROM closures with the structural and machine learning-based ROM closures, we consider the data-driven variational multiscale ROM framework and two under-resolved, convection-dominated test problems: the flow past a cylinder and the lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds numbers Re = 10000, 15000, and 20000.

To this end, we first design a novel and essential auxiliary functional that serves twofold functions: (i) ensuring that a first-order approximation to the auxiliary variable, which is essentially important for deriving the unconditional energy dissipation law, does not affect the second-order temporal accuracy of the phase function $\phi$; and (ii) allowing us to develop effective stabilization terms that are helpful to establish the MBP-preserving linear methods. Together with this novel functional and standard central difference stencil, we then propose a linear, second-order variable-step BDF2 type stabilized exponential SAV scheme, namely BDF2-sESAV-I, which is shown to preserve both the discrete modified energy dissipation law under the temporal stepsize ratio $ 0 < r_{k} := \tau_{k}/\tau_{k-1} < 4.864 - \delta $ with a positive constant $\delta$ and the MBP under $ 0 < r_{k} < 1 + \sqrt{2} $. Moreover, an analysis of the approximation to the original energy by the modified one is presented. With the help of the kernel recombination technique, optimal $ H^{1}$- and $ L^{\infty}$-norm error estimates of the variable-step BDF2-sESAV-I scheme are rigorously established.

2502.04575v1,Complexity Analysis of Normalizing Constant Estimation: from Jarzynski Equality to Annealed Importance Sampling and beyond,Wei Guo; Molei Tao; Yongxin Chen,"Given an unnormalized probability density $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-V}$, estimating its normalizing constant $Z=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\mathrm{e}^{-V(x)}\mathrm{d}x$ or free energy $F=-\log Z$ is a crucial problem in Bayesian statistics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning. It is challenging especially in high dimensions or when $\pi$ is multimodal. To mitigate the high variance of conventional importance sampling estimators, annealing-based methods such as Jarzynski equality and annealed importance sampling are commonly adopted, yet their quantitative complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. We take a first step toward a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed importance sampling. In particular, we derive an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\mathcal{A}}^2}{\varepsilon^4}\right)$ for estimating $Z$ within $\varepsilon$ relative error with high probability, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of $V$ and $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating $\pi$ and a tractable reference distribution. Our analysis, leveraging Girsanov theorem and optimal transport, does not explicitly require isoperimetric assumptions on the target distribution.

Yastrebov; Camille Noûs,"The Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA) method is widely used to approximate admissible blocks of hierarchical matrices, or H-matrices, from discretized operators in the boundary integral method. These matrices are fully populated, making their storage and manipulation resource-intensive. ACA constructs a low-rank approximation by evaluating only a few rows and columns of the original operator, significantly reducing computational costs. A key aspect of ACA's effectiveness is the selection of pivots, which are entries common to the evaluated row and column of the original matrix. This paper proposes combining the classical, purely algebraic ACA method with a geometrical pivot selection based on the central subsets and extreme property subsets. The method is named ACA-GP, GP stands for Geometrical Pivots.

This is the well-known superiorization method (SM), where the iterates of an asymptotically convergent iterative feasibility-seeking algorithm are perturbed by objective function nonascent steps. We investigate the question under what conditions a sequence generated by an SM algorithm asymptotically converges to a feasible point whose objective function value is superior (meaning smaller or equal) to that of a feasible point reached by the corresponding unperturbed one (i.e., the exactly same feasibility-seeking algorithm that the SM algorithm employs.) This question is yet only partially answered in the literature. We present a condition under which an SM algorithm that uses negative gradient descent steps in its perturbations fails to yield such a superior outcome. The significance of the discovery of this negative condition is that it necessitates that the inverse of this condition will have to be assumed to hold in any future guarantee result for the SM. The condition is important for practitioners who use the SM because it is avoidable in experimental work with the SM, thus increasing the success rate of the method in real-world applications.",NA,NA,0,1

Xue,"A new class of non-monotone finite difference (FD) approximation methods for approximating solutions to non-degenerate stationary Hamilton-Jacobi problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions is proposed and analyzed. The new FD methods add a high order correction to the Lax-Friedrich's method while utilizing a novel cutoff to preserve the convergence properties of the Lax-Friedrich's approximation. Since monotone methods are limited to first order accuracy by the Godunov barrier, the proposed approach provides a template for boosting the accuracy of a monotone method using a modified numerical moment stabilizer with a high-order auxiliary boundary condition. Numerical tests are provided to test the utility of the approach while a novel admissibility and stability analysis technique lays a foundation for analyzing non-monotone methods.",NA,NA,0,1

Constructing PMLs for nonlocal models is often challenging, mainly due to the fact that nonlocal operators are usually associated with various kernels. We first convert the continua model to a spatial semi-discretized version by adopting quadrature-based finite difference scheme, and then derive the PML equations from the semi-discretized equations using discrete analytic continuation. The harmonic exponential fundamental solutions (plane wave modes) of the semi-discretized equations are absorbed by the PML layer without reflection and are exponentially damped. The excellent efficiency and stability of discrete PML are demonstrated in numerical tests by comparison with exact absorbing boundary conditions.",NA,NA,0,1

We propose analysis for the reflection manifold in iHiSD, and then prove its stable and nonlocal convergence from outside of the region of attraction to the saddle point, which resolves the dependence of the convergence of HiSD on the initial value. We then present and analyze a discretized iHiSD that inherits these convergence properties. Furthermore, based on the Morse theory, we prove that any two saddle points could be connected by a sequence of trajectories of iHiSD. Theoretically, this implies that a solution landscape with a finite number of stationary points could be completely constructed by means of iHiSD, which partly answers the completeness issue of the solution landscape for the first time and indicates the necessity of integrating the gradient flow in HiSD. Different methods are compared by numerical experiments to substantiate the effectiveness of the iHiSD method.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.03672v1,Physically consistent predictive reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints,Hyeonghun Kim; Boris Kramer,"Numerical simulations of complex multiphysics systems, such as char combustion considered herein, yield numerous state variables that inherently exhibit physical constraints. This paper presents a new approach to augment Operator Inference -- a methodology within scientific machine learning that enables learning from data a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional system governed by nonlinear partial differential equations -- by embedding such state constraints in the reduced-order model predictions. In the model learning process, we propose a new way to choose regularization hyperparameters based on a key performance indicator. Since embedding state constraints improves the stability of the Operator Inference reduced-order model, we compare the proposed state constraints-embedded Operator Inference with the standard Operator Inference and other stability-enhancing approaches. For an application to char combustion, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields state predictions superior to the other methods regarding stability and accuracy.

2502.03645v1,MNE: overparametrized neural evolution with applications to diffusion processes and sampling,Michael Lindsey,"We propose a framework for solving evolution equations within parametric function classes, especially ones that are specified by neural networks. We call this framework the minimal neural evolution (MNE) because it is motivated by the goal of seeking the smallest instantaneous change in the neural network parameters that is compatible with exact solution of the evolution equation at a set of evolving collocation points. Formally, the MNE is quite similar to the recently introduced Neural Galerkin framework, but a difference in perspective motivates an alternative sketching procedure that effectively reduces the linear systems solved within the integrator to a size that is interpretable as an effective rank of the evolving neural tangent kernel, while maintaining a smooth evolution equation for the neural network parameters. We focus specifically on the application of this framework to diffusion processes, where the score function allows us to define intuitive dynamics for the collocation points. These can in turn be propagated jointly with the neural network parameters using a high-order adaptive integrator. In particular, we demonstrate how the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process can be used for the task of sampling from a probability distribution given a formula for the density but no training data. This framework extends naturally to allow for conditional sampling and marginalization, and we show how to systematically remove the sampling bias due to parametric approximation error. We validate the efficiency, systematic improvability, and scalability of our approach on illustrative examples in low and high spatial dimensions.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.03644v1,"Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods: What, Why, and How?",Fred J. Hickernell; Nathan Kirk; Aleksei G. Sorokin,"Many questions in quantitative finance, uncertainty quantification, and other disciplines are answered by computing the population mean, $\mu := \mathbb{E}(Y)$, where instances of $Y:=f(\boldsymbol{X})$ may be generated by numerical simulation and $\boldsymbol{X}$ has a simple probability distribution. The population mean can be approximated by the sample mean, $\hat{\mu}_n := n^{-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(\boldsymbol{x}_i)$ for a well chosen sequence of nodes, $\{\boldsymbol{x}_0, \boldsymbol{x}_1, \ldots\}$ and a sufficiently large sample size, $n$. Computing $\mu$ is equivalent to computing a $d$-dimensional integral, $\int f(\boldsymbol{x}) \varrho(\boldsymbol{x}) \, \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{x}$, where $\varrho$ is the probability density for $\boldsymbol{X}$.   Quasi-Monte Carlo methods replace independent and identically distributed sequences of random vector nodes, $\{\boldsymbol{x}_i \}_{i = 0}^{\infty}$, by low discrepancy sequences. This accelerates the convergence of $\hat{\mu}_n$ to $\mu$ as $n \to \infty$.   This tutorial describes low discrepancy sequences and their quality measures. We demonstrate the performance gains possible with quasi-Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, we describe how to formulate problems to realize the greatest performance gains using quasi-Monte Carlo.

Our projections are defined locally, are bounded in the L2-norm, and commute with the corresponding differential operators. The cornerstone of the construction are local weight functions which are piecewise polynomials built using the Alfeld split of local patches from the original simplicial mesh. This way, the L2-stability of the projections is established by invoking discrete Poincar\'e inequalities on these local stars, for which we provide constructive proofs.

Recent work shows that transformers are universal in context, capable of approximating any real-valued continuous function of a context (a probability measure over $\mathcal{X}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$) and a query $x\in \mathcal{X}$. This raises the question: Does in-context universality explain their advantage over classical models? We answer this in the negative by proving that MLPs with trainable activation functions are also universal in-context. This suggests the transformer's success is likely due to other factors like inductive bias or training stability.",NA,NA,0,1

Vigmond; Gernot Plank,"Computational models of atrial electrophysiology (EP) are increasingly utilized for applications such as the development of advanced mapping systems, personalized clinical therapy planning, and the generation of virtual cohorts and digital twins. These models have the potential to establish robust causal links between simulated in silico behaviors and observed human atrial EP, enabling safer, cost-effective, and comprehensive exploration of atrial dynamics. However, current state-of-the-art approaches lack the fidelity and scalability required for regulatory-grade applications, particularly in creating high-quality virtual cohorts or patient-specific digital twins. Challenges include anatomically accurate model generation, calibration to sparse and uncertain clinical data, and computational efficiency within a streamlined workflow. This study addresses these limitations by introducing novel methodologies integrated into an automated end-to-end workflow for generating high-fidelity digital twin snapshots and virtual cohorts of atrial EP. These innovations include: (i) automated multi-scale generation of volumetric biatrial models with detailed anatomical structures and fiber architecture; (ii) a robust method for defining space-varying atrial parameter fields; (iii) a parametric approach for modeling inter-atrial conduction pathways; and (iv) an efficient forward EP model for high-fidelity electrocardiogram computation. We evaluated this workflow on a cohort of 50 atrial fibrillation patients, producing high-quality meshes suitable for reaction-eikonal and reaction-diffusion models and demonstrating the ability to simulate atrial ECGs under parametrically controlled conditions.

2502.03281v1,Efficient sampling approaches based on generalized Golub-Kahan methods for large-scale hierarchical Bayesian inverse problems,Elle Buser; Julianne Chung,"Uncertainty quantification for large-scale inverse problems remains a challenging task. For linear inverse problems with additive Gaussian noise and Gaussian priors, the posterior is Gaussian but sampling can be challenging, especially for problems with a very large number of unknown parameters (e.g., dynamic inverse problems) and for problems where computation of the square root and inverse of the prior covariance matrix are not feasible. Moreover, for hierarchical problems where several hyperparameters that define the prior and the noise model must be estimated from the data, the posterior distribution may no longer be Gaussian, even if the forward operator is linear. Performing large-scale uncertainty quantification for these hierarchical settings requires new computational techniques. In this work, we consider a hierarchical Bayesian framework where both the noise and prior variance are modeled as hyperparameters. Our approach uses Metropolis-Hastings independence sampling within Gibbs where the proposal distribution is based on generalized Golub-Kahan based methods. We consider two proposal samplers, one that uses a low rank approximation to the conditional covariance matrix and another that uses a preconditioned Lanczos method. Numerical examples from seismic imaging, dynamic photoacoustic tomography, and atmospheric inverse modeling demonstrate the effectiveness of the described approaches.",NA,NA,0,1

To improve computational efficiency, different and adaptive time steps in the subsolvers are advisable. Using so called waveform iterations in combination with relaxation, this has been achieved for heat transfer problems earlier. Alternatively, one can use a black box method like Quasi-Newton to improve the convergence behaviour. These methods have recently been combined with waveform iterations for fixed time steps. Here, we suggest an extension of the Quasi-Newton method to the time adaptive setting and analyze its properties.   We compare the proposed Quasi-Newton method with state of the art solvers on a heat transfer test case, and a complex mechanical Fluid-Structure interaction case, demonstrating the methods efficiency.",NA,NA,0,1

For univariate functions, the adaptive Antoulas-Anderson algorithm (AAA), which uses the barycentric form of a rational approximant, has established itself as a powerful tool for efficiently computing such approximations. The p-AAA algorithm, an extension of the AAA algorithm specifically designed to address multivariate approximation problems, has been recently introduced. A common challenge in multivariate approximation methods is that multivariate problems with a large number of variables often pose significant memory and computational demands. To tackle this hurdle in the setting of p-AAA, we first introduce barycentric forms that are represented in the terms of separable functions. This then leads to the low-rank p-AAA algorithm which leverages low-rank tensor decompositions in the setting of barycentric rational approximations. We discuss various theoretical and practical aspects of the proposed computational framework and showcase its effectiveness on four numerical examples.

The method is formulated on body-fitted polygonal meshes, where interface edges are straight and may not align exactly with the curved physical interface. To address this discrepancy, a boundary value correction technique is employed to transfer the interface conditions from the physical interface to the approximate interface using a Taylor expansion approach. The Neumann interface condition is then weakly imposed in the variational formulation.

However, the computation and storage of the Hessian matrix using second order partial derivatives is prohibitive in many contexts, and in particular in large scale problems. In this work, we propose a new framework for computing and presenting second order information in analytic form. The key novel insight is that the Hessian for a problem can be worked with efficiently by computing its bilinear form or operator form using Taylor expansions, instead of introducing a basis and then computing the Hessian matrix. Our new framework is suited for high-dimensional problems stemming e.g. from imaging applications, where computation of the Hessian matrix is unfeasible.

Theoretical guarantees for many standard iterative low-rank recovery methods, such as iterative hard thresholding (IHT), are based on model assumptions on the measurement operator, like the restricted isometry property (RIP). However, tensor-structured random linear maps -- while memory-efficient and convenient to apply -- lack good restricted isometry properties; that is, they do not preserve the norms of low-rank tensors sufficiently well.   To address this, we propose local trimming techniques that provably restore point-wise geometry-preservation properties of tensor-structured maps, making them comparable to those of unstructured sub-Gaussian measurements. Then, we propose two novel versions of tensor IHT algorithms: an adaptive gradient trimming algorithm and a randomized Kaczmarz-based IHT algorithm, that efficiently recover low-rank tensors from linear measurements.

Nagy,"Iterative Krylov projection methods have become widely used for solving large-scale linear inverse problems. However, methods based on orthogonality include the computation of inner-products, which become costly when the number of iterations is high; are a bottleneck for parallelization; and can cause the algorithms to break down in low precision due to information loss in the projections. Recent works on inner-product free Krylov iterative algorithms alleviate these concerns, but they are quasi-minimal residual rather than minimal residual methods. This is a potential concern for inverse problems where the residual norm provides critical information from the observations via the likelihood function, and we do not have any way of controlling how close the quasi-norm is from the norm we want to minimize. In this work, we introduce a new Krylov method that is both inner-product-free and minimizes a functional that is theoretically closer to the residual norm. The proposed scheme combines an inner-product free Hessenberg projection approach for generating a solution subspace with a randomized sketch-and-solve approach for solving the resulting strongly overdetermined projected least-squares problem.

In its usual form, the condition states that for every pressure $p\in L^2(\Omega)\setminus \mathbb{R}$, (i.e. with mean value zero) a velocity $u\in H^1_0(\Omega)^d$ can be found, so that $(div\,u,p)=\|p\|^2$ and $\|\nabla u\|\le c \|p\|$ applies, where $c>0$ does not depend on $u$ and $p$. However, if we consider domains that have a Neumann-type outflow condition on part of the boundary $\Gamma_N\subset\partial\Omega$, the inf-sup condition cannot be used in this form, since the pressure here comes from $L^2(\Omega)$ and does not necessarily have zero mean value. In this note, we derive the inf-sup condition for the case of outflow boundaries.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2502.02113v1,Mathematical analysis and numerical simulation of coupled nonlinear space-fractional Ginzburg-Landau equations,Hengfei Ding; Yuxin Zhang; Qian Yi,"The coupled nonlinear space fractional Ginzburg-Landau (CNLSFGL) equations with the fractional Laplacian have been widely used to model the dynamical processes in   a fractal media with fractional dispersion. Due to the existence of fractional power derivatives and strong nonlinearity, it is extremely difficult to mathematically analyze the CNLSFGL equations and construct efficient numerical algorithms. For this reason, this paper aims to investigate the theoretical results about the considered system and construct a novel high-order numerical scheme for this coupled system. We prove   rigorously an a priori estimate of the solution to the coupled system and the well-posedness of its weak solution. Then, to develop the efficient numerical algorithm, we construct a fourth-order numerical differential formula to approximate the fractional Laplacian. Based on this formula, we   construct a high-order implicit difference scheme for the coupled system. Furthermore,   the unique solvability and convergence of the established algorithm are proved in detail.   To implement the implicit algorithm efficiently, an iterative algorithm is designed in   the numerical simulation. Extensive numerical examples are reported to further   demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the efficiency of the proposed numerical algorithm.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.02089v1,Implicit integration factor method coupled with Padé approximation strategy for nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation,Yuxin Zhang; Hengfei Ding,"The space nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation is a famous example of fractional reaction-diffusion equations. It is also an extension of the classical Allen-Cahn equation, which is widely used in physics to describe the phenomenon of two-phase fluid flows.Due to the nonlocality of the nonlocal operator, numerical solutions to these equations face considerable challenges.It is worth noting that whether we use low-order or high-order numerical differential formulas to approximate the operator, the corresponding matrix is always dense, which implies that the storage space and computational cost required for the former and the latter are the same. However, the higher-order formula can significantly improve the accuracy of the numerical scheme.Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to construct a high-order numerical formula that approximates the nonlocal operator.To reduce the time step limitation in existing numerical algorithms, we employed a technique combining the compact integration factor method with the Pad\'{e} approximation strategy to discretize the time derivative.A novel high-order numerical scheme, which satisfies both the maximum principle and energy stability for the space nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation, is proposed.Furthermore, we provide a detailed error analysis of the differential scheme, which shows that its convergence order is $\mathcal{O}\left(\tau^2+h^6\right)$.Especially, it is worth mentioning that the fully implicit scheme with sixth-order accuracy in spatial has never been proven to maintain the maximum principle and energy stability before.Finally, some numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",NA,NA,0,1

The transversal performances of full scale, masonry barrel vault samples, i.e. running bond pattern vaults and brick in folio vaults, carrying their own weight and reinforced at the extrados or at the intrados are investigated through cyclic tests. The connection of the reinforced vaults with the masonry abutment is particularly considered and discussed, due to the importance of this detail to avoid uplift and slip at the skewback sections and better exploit the CRM benefits. The experimental behavior of the vault samples is described and analyzed in terms of global behavior, crack pattern and load displacement curves, also in comparison with the unreinforced configurations. The CRM allowed significant improvements in both vaults strength and displacement capacities, as contrasted the cracks opening and foster the spreading of cracks all along the vault. Considerable performances emerged also in terms of dissipative capacities, with a mean damping value of about 0.13 in the post cracking configuration. The vault-to-wall connection, based on embedded steel and composite bars, resulted essential for avoiding dangerous vault sliding at skewback sections, that may reduce the vault performances and also cause the fall from the support.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.01938v1,A Kolmogorov High Order Deep Neural Network for High Frequency Partial Differential Equations in High Dimensions,Yaqin Zhang; Ke Li; Zhipeng Chang; Xuejiao Liu; Yunqing Huang; Xueshuang Xiang,"This paper proposes a Kolmogorov high order deep neural network (K-HOrderDNN) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), which improves the high order deep neural networks (HOrderDNNs). HOrderDNNs have been demonstrated to outperform conventional DNNs for high frequency problems by introducing a nonlinear transformation layer consisting of $(p+1)^d$ basis functions. However, the number of basis functions grows exponentially with the dimension $d$, which results in the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Inspired by the Kolmogorov superposition theorem (KST), which expresses a multivariate function as superpositions of univariate functions and addition, K-HOrderDNN utilizes a HOrderDNN to efficiently approximate univariate inner functions instead of directly approximating the multivariate function, reducing the number of introduced basis functions to $d(p+1)$. We theoretically demonstrate that CoD is mitigated when target functions belong to a dense subset of continuous multivariate functions. Extensive numerical experiments show that: for high-dimensional problems ($d$=10, 20, 50) where HOrderDNNs($p>1$) are intractable, K-HOrderDNNs($p>1$) exhibit remarkable performance. Specifically, when $d=10$, K-HOrderDNN($p=7$) achieves an error of 4.40E-03, two orders of magnitude lower than that of HOrderDNN($p=1$) (see Table 10); for high frequency problems, K-HOrderDNNs($p>1$) can achieve higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence rates compared to HOrderDNNs (see Table 8).",NA,NA,0,1
2502.01888v1,Randomized block-Krylov subspace methods for low-rank approximation of matrix functions,David Persson; Tyler Chen; Christopher Musco,"The randomized SVD is a method to compute an inexpensive, yet accurate, low-rank approximation of a matrix. The algorithm assumes access to the matrix through matrix-vector products (matvecs). Therefore, when we would like to apply the randomized SVD to a matrix function, $f(A)$, one needs to approximate matvecs with $f(A)$ using some other algorithm, which is typically treated as a black-box. Chen and Hallman (SIMAX 2023) argued that, in the common setting where matvecs with $f(A)$ are approximated using Krylov subspace methods (KSMs), more efficient low-rank approximation is possible if we open this black-box. They present an alternative approach that significantly outperforms the naive combination of KSMs with the randomized SVD, although the method lacked theoretical justification. In this work, we take a closer look at the method, and provide strong and intuitive error bounds that justify its excellent performance for low-rank approximation of matrix functions.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.01859v1,Fully discrete analysis of the Galerkin POD neural network approximation with application to 3D acoustic wave scattering,Jürgen Dölz; Fernando Henríquez,"In this work, we consider the approximation of parametric maps using the so-called Galerkin POD-NN method. This technique combines the computation of a reduced basis via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and artificial neural networks (NNs) for the construction of fast surrogates of said parametric maps. We provide a fully discrete error analysis of this method that accounts for different discretization errors, including the number of reduced basis in the approximation of the solution manifold, truncation in the parameter space, and, most importantly, the number of samples in the computation of the reduced space, together with the effect of the use of NNs in the approximation of the reduced coefficients. Following this error analysis we provide a-priori bounds on the required POD tolerance, the resulting POD ranks, and NN-parameters to maintain the order of convergence of quasi Monte Carlo sampling techniques. The main advantage of Galerkin POD-NN over existing traditional techniques is that the online and offline phases of the projection-based reduced basis method are completely decoupled, making the evaluation of the constructed surrogate in run-time considerably faster without the need for an hyper-reduction technique. We conclude this work by showcasing the applicability of this method through a practical industrial application: the sound-soft acoustic scattering problem by a parametrically defined scatterer in three physical dimensions.",NA,NA,0,1

These estimators are defined for all source terms that are admissible to the underlying weak formulations. More importantly, they are equivalent to the error in a strict sense. In particular, their data oscillation part is bounded by the error and, furthermore, can be designed to be bounded by classical data oscillations. The estimators are computable, except for the data oscillation part. Since even the computation of some bound of the oscillation part is not possible in general, we advocate to handle it on a case-by-case basis. We illustrate the practical use of two estimators obtained for the Crouzeix-Raviart method applied to the Poisson problem with a source term that is not a function and its singular part with respect to the Lebesgues measure is not aligned with the mesh.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.01418v1,Assessing the use of Diffusion models for motion artifact correction in brain MRI,Paolo Angella; Vito Paolo Pastore; Matteo Santacesaria,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging generally requires long exposure times, while being sensitive to patient motion, resulting in artifacts in the acquired images, which may hinder their diagnostic relevance. Despite research efforts to decrease the acquisition time, and designing efficient acquisition sequences, motion artifacts are still a persistent problem, pushing toward the need for the development of automatic motion artifact correction techniques. Recently, diffusion models have been proposed as a solution for the task at hand. While diffusion models can produce high-quality reconstructions, they are also susceptible to hallucination, which poses risks in diagnostic applications. In this study, we critically evaluate the use of diffusion models for correcting motion artifacts in 2D brain MRI scans. Using a popular benchmark dataset, we compare a diffusion model-based approach with state-of-the-art methods consisting of Unets trained in a supervised fashion on motion-affected images to reconstruct ground truth motion-free images. Our findings reveal mixed results: diffusion models can produce accurate predictions or generate harmful hallucinations in this context, depending on data heterogeneity and the acquisition planes considered as input.",NA,NA,0,1

We introduce a new benchmark dataset of matrices where good sparse preconditioners exist but require non-local computations, constructed using both synthetic examples and real-world matrices. Our experimental results show that current GNN architectures struggle to approximate these preconditioners, suggesting the need for new architectural approaches beyond traditional message passing networks. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to explain these limitations, with implications for the broader use of GNNs in numerical linear algebra.",NA,NA,0,1

2502.01368v1,A hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model for arbitrary flows to the fluid--porous interface,Linheng Ruan; Iryna Rybak,"Mathematical modelling of coupled flow systems containing a free-flow region in contact with a porous medium is challenging, especially for arbitrary flow directions to the fluid--porous interface. Transport processes in the free flow and porous medium are typically described by distinct equations: the Stokes equations and Darcy's law, respectively, with an appropriate set of coupling conditions at the common interface. Classical interface conditions based on the Beavers--Joseph condition are not accurate for general flows. Several generalisations are recently developed for arbitrary flows at the interface, some of them are however only theoretically formulated and still need to be validated.   In this manuscript, we propose an alternative to couple free flow and porous-medium flow, namely, the hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model. Such formulation incorporates the averaged Brinkman equations within a complex interface between the free-flow and porous-medium regions. The complex interface acts as a buffer zone facilitating storage and transport of mass and momentum and the model is applicable for arbitrary flow directions. We validate the proposed hybrid-dimensional model against the pore-scale resolved model in multiple examples and compare numerical simulation results also with the classical and generalised coupling conditions from the literature. The proposed hybrid-dimensional model demonstrates its applicability to describe arbitrary coupled flows and shows its advantages in comparison to other generalised coupling conditions.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1
2502.01358v1,Diffusion at Absolute Zero: Langevin Sampling Using Successive Moreau Envelopes,Andreas Habring; Alexander Falk; Thomas Pock,"In this article we propose a novel method for sampling from Gibbs distributions of the form $\pi(x)\propto\exp(-U(x))$ with a potential $U(x)$. In particular, inspired by diffusion models we propose to consider a sequence $(\pi^{t_k})_k$ of approximations of the target density, for which $\pi^{t_k}\approx \pi$ for $k$ small and, on the other hand, $\pi^{t_k}$ exhibits favorable properties for sampling for $k$ large. This sequence is obtained by replacing parts of the potential $U$ by its Moreau envelopes. Sampling is performed in an Annealed Langevin type procedure, that is, sequentially sampling from $\pi^{t_k}$ for decreasing $k$, effectively guiding the samples from a simple starting density to the more complex target. In addition to a theoretical analysis we show experimental results supporting the efficacy of the method in terms of increased convergence speed and applicability to multi-modal densities $\pi$.",NA,NA,0,1

In this work, we propose an improved relaxation scheme for higher-order Taylor-Hood discretizations of the incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrating its efficiency within monolithic multigrid preconditioners for the linear(ized) equations. The key to this improvement is an improved patch construction for Vanka-style relaxation introducing, for the first time, overlap in the pressure degrees of freedom within the patches. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvement in both multigrid iterations and time-to-solution for the linear Stokes case, on both triangular and quadrilateral meshes.

First coupling technique is the well known mortar method, that uses classical multipliers and is compared with a new formulation of the method of localized Lagrange multipliers (LLM) for FSI applications with non-matching interfaces. The proposed non-overlapping domain decomposition technique uses a classical non-symmetrical acoustic BEM formulation for the fluid, although a symmetric Galerkin BEM formulation could be used as well.

2502.00882v1,Worth Their Weight: Randomized and Regularized Block Kaczmarz Algorithms without Preprocessing,Gil Goldshlager; Jiang Hu; Lin Lin,"Due to the ever growing amounts of data leveraged for machine learning and scientific computing, it is increasingly important to develop algorithms that sample only a small portion of the data at a time. In the case of linear least-squares, the randomized block Kaczmarz method (RBK) is an appealing example of such an algorithm, but its convergence is only understood under sampling distributions that require potentially prohibitively expensive preprocessing steps. To address this limitation, we analyze RBK when the data is sampled uniformly, showing that its iterates converge in a Monte Carlo sense to a $\textit{weighted}$ least-squares solution. Unfortunately, for general problems the condition number of the weight matrix and the variance of the iterates can become arbitrarily large. We resolve these issues by incorporating regularization into the RBK iterations. Numerical experiments, including examples arising from natural gradient optimization, suggest that the regularized algorithm, ReBlocK, outperforms minibatch stochastic gradient descent for realistic problems that exhibit fast singular value decay.",NA,NA,0,1

It is a simpler implementation because there is no need to form a dual control volume by connecting edge-midpoints, face centroids, and element centroids, and also reduces the time for computing lumped directed-area vectors for a given grid, especially for tetrahedral grids. The speed-up achieved by the proposed algorithm may not be large enough to greatly impact the overall simulation time, but the proposed algorithm is expected to serve as a major stepping stone towards extending the edge-based discretization to four dimensions and beyond (e.g., space-time simulations). Efficient algorithms for computing lumped directed-area vectors and dual volumes without forming dual volumes are presented, and their implementations are described and compared with traditional algorithms in terms of complexity as well as actual computing time for a given grid.",NA,NA,0,1

2502.00655v1,Parameter Choices for Sparse Multi-Parameter Regularization with the $\ell_1$ Norm,Qianru Liu; Rui Wang; Yuesheng Xu,"This paper introduces a multi-parameter regularization approach using the $\ell_1$ norm, designed to better adapt to complex data structures and problem characteristics while offering enhanced flexibility in promoting sparsity in regularized solutions. As data volumes grow, sparse representations of learned functions become critical for reducing computational costs during function operations. We investigate how the selection of multiple regularization parameters influences the sparsity of regularized solutions. Specifically, we characterize the relationship between these parameters and the sparsity of solutions under transform matrices, enabling the development of an iterative scheme for selecting parameters that achieve prescribed sparsity levels. Special attention is given to scenarios where the fidelity term is non-differentiable, and the transform matrix lacks full row rank. In such cases, the regularized solution, along with two auxiliary vectors arising in the sparsity characterization, are essential components of the multi-parameter selection strategy. To address this, we propose a fixed-point proximity algorithm that simultaneously determines these three vectors. This algorithm, combined with our sparsity characterization, forms the basis of a practical multi-parameter selection strategy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, yielding regularized solutions with both predetermined sparsity levels and satisfactory approximation accuracy.",NA,NA,0,1

Ferri Aliabadi,"A coupled boundary spectral element method (BSEM) and spectral element method (SEM) formulation for the propagation of small-amplitude water waves over variable bathymetries is presented in this work. The wave model is based on the mild-slope equation (MSE), which provides a good approximation of the propagation of water waves over irregular bottom surfaces with slopes up to 1:3. In unbounded domains or infinite regions, space can be divided into two different areas: a central region of interest, where an irregular bathymetry is included, and an exterior infinite region with straight and parallel bathymetric lines. The SEM allows us to model the central region, where any variation of the bathymetry can be considered, while the exterior infinite region is modelled by the BSEM which, combined with the fundamental solution presented by Cerrato et al.

This coupled model combines important advantages of both methods; it benefits from the flexibility of the SEM for the interior region and, at the same time, includes the fulfilment of the Sommerfeld's radiation condition for the exterior problem, that is provided by the BSEM. The solution approximation inside the elements is constructed by high order Legendre polynomials associated with Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points, providing a spectral convergence for both methods.

However, this framework often requires substantial amounts of high-fidelity (HF) training data, which is often prohibitively expensive to acquire. To address this, we propose multi-fidelity Laplace Neural Operators (MF-LNOs), which combine a low-fidelity (LF) base model with parallel linear/nonlinear HF correctors and dynamic inter-fidelity weighting. This allows us to exploit correlations between LF and HF datasets and achieve accurate inference of quantities of interest even with sparse HF data. We further incorporate a modified replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm, which enables a more effective posterior distribution estimation and uncertainty quantification in model predictions. Extensive validation across four canonical dynamical systems (the Lorenz system, Duffing oscillator, Burgers equation, and Brusselator reaction-diffusion system) demonstrates the framework's effectiveness. The results show significant improvements, with testing losses reduced by 40% to 80% compared to traditional approaches.

The ability of the proposed formulation to accurately represent wave phenomena like refraction, reflection, diffraction and shoaling, is demonstrated with the solution of some example problems, in which arbitrary geometries and variable seabed profiles with slopes up to 1:3 are considered.

In this paper, we introduce a novel way to exploit the theory of $\textbf{logarithmic norms}$: we introduce the concept of a $\textbf{radical transform}$ $\pi:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ to convert the above $(\textbf{x},\textbf{f})$-system into another system $\textbf{y}' = \textbf{g}(\textbf{y})$ so that the $(\textbf{y},\textbf{g})$-space has negative logarithmic norm in any desired small enough neighborhood.   Based on such radical transform steps, we construct a complete validated algorithm for the following $\textbf{End-Enclosure Problem}$:   \begin{equation} INPUT: (\textbf{f}, B_0,\varepsilon), \qquad\qquad OUTPUT: (\underline{B}_0,B_1)   \end{equation} where $B_0\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a box, $\varepsilon>0$, such that $\underline{B}_0\subseteq B_0$, the diameter of $B_1$ is at most $\varepsilon$, and $B_1$ is an end-enclosure for $\texttt{IVP}(\underline{B}_0)$, i.e., for all $\textbf{x}\in \texttt{IVP}(\underline{B}_0)$, $\textbf{x}(1)\in B_1$.

Training neural networks for sharp interface problems is particularly challenging due to certain parameters in the PDEs that introduce near-singularities in the loss function. In this study, we overcome this challenge by introducing a novel method based on homotopy dynamics to effectively manipulate these parameters. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze the effects of these parameters on training difficulty in sharp interface problems and establish the convergence of the proposed homotopy dynamics method. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence and improves the accuracy of sharp interface capturing. These findings present an efficient optimization strategy leveraging homotopy dynamics, offering a robust framework to extend the applicability of neural networks for solving PDEs with sharp",NA,NA,0,1
2502.00452v1,Mass lumping and stabilization for immersogeometric analysis,Yannis Voet; Espen Sande; Annalisa Buffa,"Trimmed (multi-patch) geometries are the state-of-the-art technology in computer-aided design for industrial applications such as automobile crashworthiness. In this context, fast solution techniques extensively rely on explicit time integration schemes in conjunction with mass lumping techniques that substitute the consistent mass with a (usually diagonal) approximation. For smooth isogeometric discretizations, Leidinger [1] first showed that mass lumping removed the dependency of the critical time-step on the size of trimmed elements. This finding has attracted considerable attention but has unfortunately overshadowed another more subtle effect: mass lumping may disastrously impact the accuracy of low frequencies and modes, potentially inducing spurious oscillations in the solution. In this article, we provide compelling evidence for this phenomenon and later propose a stabilization technique based on polynomial extensions that restores a level of accuracy comparable to boundary-fitted discretizations.",NA,NA,0,1
2502.00393v1,The multi-index Monte Carlo method for semilinear stochastic partial differential equations,Abdul-Lateef Haji-Ali; Håkon Hoel; Andreas Petersson,"Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are often difficult to solve numerically due to their low regularity and high dimensionality. These challenges limit the practical use of computer-aided studies and pose significant barriers to statistical analysis of SPDEs. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient multi-index Monte Carlo method (MIMC) designed to approximate statistics of mild solutions to semilinear parabolic SPDEs. Key to our approach is the proof of a multiplicative convergence property for coupled solutions generated by an exponential integrator numerical solver, which we incorporate with MIMC. We further describe theoretically how the asymptotic computational cost of MIMC can be bounded in terms of the input accuracy tolerance, as the tolerance goes to zero. Notably, our methodology illustrates that for an SPDE with low regularity, MIMC offers substantial performance improvements over other viable methods. Numerical experiments comparing the performance of MIMC with the multilevel Monte Carlo method on relevant test problems validate our theoretical findings. These results also demonstrate that MIMC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multilevel Monte Carlo, thereby underscoring its potential as a robust and tractable tool for solving semilinear parabolic SPDEs.",NA,NA,0,1

Existing PINNs often suffer from failure modes of being unable to propagate patterns of initial conditions. We discover that these failure modes are caused by the simplicity bias of neural networks and the mismatch between PDE's continuity and PINN's discrete sampling. We reveal that the State Space Model (SSM) can be a continuous-discrete articulation allowing initial condition propagation, and that simplicity bias can be eliminated by aligning a sequence of moderate granularity. Accordingly, we propose PINNMamba, a novel framework that introduces sub-sequence modeling with SSM.

This issue is particularly pronounced in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), widely used to solve differential equations that describe physical phenomena. In the literature, contributions such as Wavelet Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (Wav-KANs) have demonstrated promising results in capturing both low- and high-frequency components. Similarly, Fourier features (FF) are often employed to address this challenge. However, the theoretical foundations of Wav-KANs, particularly the relationship between the frequency of the mother wavelet and spectral bias, remain underexplored. A more in-depth understanding of how Wav-KANs manage high-frequency terms could offer valuable insights for addressing oscillatory phenomena encountered in parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic differential equations. In this work, we analyze the eigenvalues of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of Wav-KANs to enhance their ability to converge on high-frequency components, effectively mitigating spectral bias. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments, where we also discuss the limitations of traditional approaches, such as standard PINNs and Fourier features, in addressing multi-frequency problems.",NA,NA,0,1

Rotskoff; Molei Tao; Lexing Ying,"Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative modeling framework for discrete data with successful applications spanning from text generation to image synthesis. However, their deployment faces challenges due to the high dimensionality of the state space, necessitating the development of efficient inference algorithms. Current inference approaches mainly fall into two categories: exact simulation and approximate methods such as $\tau$-leaping. While exact methods suffer from unpredictable inference time and redundant function evaluations, $\tau$-leaping is limited by its first-order accuracy. In this work, we advance the latter category by tailoring the first extension of high-order numerical inference schemes to discrete diffusion models, enabling larger step sizes while reducing error. We rigorously analyze the proposed schemes and establish the second-order accuracy of the $\theta$-trapezoidal method in KL divergence.

The methods employ the lowest-order enhanced Raviart-Thomas finite element space for the stress and piecewise constant displacement. The vertex quadrature rule is employed to localize the interaction of stress degrees of freedom, enabling local stress elimination around each vertex. We introduce two methods. The first method uses a piecewise constant rotation, resulting in a cell-centered system for the displacement and rotation. The second method employs a continuous piecewise trilinear rotation and the vertex quadrature rule for the asymmetry bilinear forms, allowing for further elimination of the rotation and resulting in a cell-centered system for the displacement only. Stability and error analysis is performed for both methods. For the stability analysis of the second method, a new auxiliary H-curl conforming matrix-valued space is constructed, which forms an exact sequence with the stress space. A matrix-matrix inf-sup condition is shown for the curl of this auxiliary space and the trilinear rotation space. First-order convergence is established for all variables in their natural norms, as well as second-order superconvergence of the displacement at the cell centers.

An explicit formula for this criterion is provided, assuming that the model error and background are independent and Gaussian and the dynamics are linear. % We discuss algorithmic approaches to efficiently evaluate this criterion through randomized approximations.   To provide further insight and flexibility in computations, we also provide alternative expressions for the criteria. %t We provide an algorithm to find near-optimal experimental designs using column subset selection, including a randomized algorithm that avoids computing the adjoint of the forward operator. % Through numerical experiments in one and two spatial dimensions, we show the effectiveness of our proposed methods.",NA,NA,0,1

Most existing research focuses on cases with no {constraint} or easy-to-project constraints or deterministic constraints. In this paper, we consider nonconvex nonsmooth stochastic optimization problems with expectation constraints, for which we build a novel exact penalty model. We first show the relationship between the penalty model and the original problem. Then on solving the penalty problem, we present a single-loop SPIDER-type stochastic subgradient method, which utilizes the subgradients of both the objective and constraint functions, as well as the constraint function value at each iteration. Under certain regularity conditions (weaker than Slater-type constraint qualification or strong feasibility assumed in existing works), we establish an iteration complexity result of $O(\epsilon^{-4})$ to reach a near-$\epsilon$ stationary point of the penalized problem in expectation, matching the lower bound for such tasks. Building on the exact penalization, an $(\epsilon,\epsilon)$-KKT point of the original problem is obtained. For a few scenarios, our complexity of either the {objective} sample subgradient or the constraint sample function values can be lower than the state-of-the-art results by a factor of $\epsilon^{-2}$. Moreover, on solving two fairness-constrained problems, our method is significantly (up to 466 times) faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms, including switching subgradient method and inexact proximal point methods.",NA,NA,0,1

In this paper, we present and test the convergence behavior of a multiscale, micro-macro version of a Parareal method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In our method, the fine propagator of the SDE is based on a high-dimensional slow-fast microscopic model; the coarse propagator is based on a model-reduced version of the latter, that captures the low-dimensional, effective dynamics at the slow time scales.

2501.19013v1,On the efficiency of explicit and semi-explicit immersed boundary finite element methods for wave propagation problems,Tim Bürchner; Lars Radtke; Philipp Kopp; Stefan Kollmannsberger; Ernst Rank; Alexander Düster,"Immersed boundary methods have attracted substantial interest in the last decades due to their potential for computations involving complex geometries. Often these cannot be efficiently discretized using boundary-fitted finite elements. Immersed boundary methods provide a simple and fully automatic discretization based on Cartesian grids and tailored quadrature schemes that account for the geometric model. It can thus be described independently of the grid, e.g., by image data obtained from computed tomography scans. The drawback of such a discretization lies in the potentially small overlap between certain elements in the grid and the geometry. These badly cut elements with small physical support pose a particular challenge for nonlinear and/or dynamic simulations. In this work, we focus on problems in structural dynamics and acoustics and concentrate on solving them with explicit time-marching schemes. In this context, badly cut elements can lead to unfeasibly small critical time step sizes. We investigate the performance of implicit-explicit time marching schemes and two stabilization methods developed in previous works as potential remedies. While these have been studied before with regard to their effectiveness in increasing the critical time step size, their numerical efficiency has only been considered in terms of accuracy per degree of freedom. In this paper, we evaluate the computation time required for a given accuracy, which depends not only on the number of degrees of freedom but also on the selected spatial discretization, the sparsity patterns of the system matrices, and the employed time-marching scheme.",NA,NA,0,1

This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 2.9x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations.

Physics-based models rely on the physical understanding of the problem at hand, subsequent mathematical formulation, and numerical approximation. Data-driven models instead aim to extract relations between input and output data without arguing any causality principle underlining the available data distribution. In recent years, data-driven models have been rapidly developed and popularized. Such a diffusion has been triggered by a huge availability of data (the so-called big data), an increasingly cheap computing power, and the development of powerful machine learning algorithms. SciML leverages the physical awareness of physics-based models and, at the same time, the efficiency of data-driven algorithms. With SciML, we can inject physics and mathematical knowledge into machine learning algorithms. Yet, we can rely on data-driven algorithms' capability to discover complex and non-linear patterns from data and improve the descriptive capacity of physics-based models. After recalling the mathematical foundations of digital modelling and machine learning algorithms, and presenting the most popular machine learning architectures, we discuss the great potential of a broad variety of SciML strategies in solving complex problems governed by partial differential equations. Finally, we illustrate the successful application of SciML to the simulation of the human cardiac function, a field of significant socio-economic importance that poses numerous challenges on both the mathematical and computational fronts. The corresponding mathematical model is a complex system of non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations describing the electromechanics, valve dynamics, blood circulation, perfusion in the coronary tree, and torso potential.

Here we investigate the sensitivity of the Reynolds equation to large gradients in the surface geometry. We present an analytic solution to the Reynolds equation in a piecewise-linear domain alongside a more general finite difference solution. For the Stokes equations, we use a finite difference solution for the biharmonic stream-velocity formulation. We compare the fluid velocity, pressure, and resistance for various step bearing geometries in the lubrication and Stokes limits. We find that the solutions to the Reynolds equation do not capture flow separation resulting from large cross-film pressure gradients.

Khan,"Nonsmooth functions have been used to model discrete-continuous phenomena such as contact mechanics, and are also prevalent in neural network formulations via activation functions such as ReLU. At previous AD conferences, Griewank et al. showed that nonsmooth functions may be approximated well by piecewise-affine functions constructed using an AD-like procedure. Moreover, such a piecewise-affine function may always be represented in an ""abs-normal form"", encoding it as a collection of four matrices and two vectors. We present new general complementarity formulations for root-finding and optimization of piecewise-affine functions in abs-normal form, with significantly fewer restrictions than previous approaches. In particular, piecewise-affine root-finding may always be represented as a mixed-linear complementarity problem (MLCP), which may often be simplified to a linear complementarity problem (LCP). We also present approaches for verifying existence of solutions to these problems.

The error analysis is done in the framework of strongly continuous semigroups. Compared to classical exponential quadrature rules, which in our case of interest converge with order $1+r$ at most, we prove that the new methods may reach order $1+\nu r$ for proper choices of the collocation points.

In this study, we aim to gain a fundamental understanding of numerical simulations in this context by analyzing conforming finite element approximations of the underlying nonlinear models that describe ultrasound-heat interactions. These models are based on a coupling of a nonlinear Westervelt--Kuznetsov acoustic wave equation to the heat equation with a pressure-dependent source term. A particular challenging feature of the system is that the acoustic medium parameters may depend on the temperature. The core of our new arguments in the \emph{a prior} error analysis lies in devising energy estimates for the coupled semi-discrete system that can accommodate the nonlinearities present in the model. To derive them, we exploit the parabolic nature of the system thanks to the strong damping present in the acoustic component. Theoretically obtained optimal convergence rates in the energy norm are confirmed by the numerical experiments.

The coarse space in this preconditioner is constructed by specific eigenfunctions solving a series of generalized eigenvalue problems in the local discrete Maxwell-harmonic spaces according to a user-defined tolerance $\rho$. We establish a stability result for the considered discrete variational problem. Using this discrete stability, we prove that the two-level hybrid Schwarz preconditioner is robust in the sense that the convergence rate of GMRES is independent of the mesh size, the subdomain size and the wave-number when $\rho$ is chosen appropriately.

Bruno,"Although high-order Maxwell integral equation solvers provide significant advantages in terms of speed and accuracy over corresponding low-order integral methods, their performance significantly degrades in presence of non-smooth geometries--owing to field enhancement and singularities that arise at sharp edges and corners which, if left untreated, give rise to significant accuracy losses. The problem is particularly challenging in cases in which the ""density"" (i.e., the solution of the integral equation) tends to infinity at corners and edges--a difficulty that can be bypassed for 2D configurations, but which is unavoidable in 3D Maxwell integral formulations, wherein the component tangential to an edge of the electrical-current integral density vector tends to infinity at the edge. In order to tackle the problem this paper restricts attention to the simplest context in which the unbounded-density difficulty arises, namely, integral formulations in 2D space whose integral density blows up at corners; the strategies proposed, however, generalize directly to the 3D context. The novel methodologies presented in this paper yield high-order convergence for such challenging equations and achieve highly accurate solutions (even near edges and corners) without requiring a priori analysis of the geometry or use of singular bases.",NA,NA,0,1

We describe a modification of the Golub-Businger algorithm which, for many matrices of this type, can perform CPQR-based column selection much more efficiently. This algorithm, which we call CCEQR, is based on a three-step ``collect, commit, expand'' strategy that limits the number of columns being manipulated, while also transferring more computational effort from level-2 BLAS to level-3.

2501.18013v1,A comprehensive numerical investigation of a coupled mathematical model of neuronal excitability,Burcu Gürbüz; Aytül Gökçe; Mahmut Modanlı,"Being an example for a relaxation oscillator, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model has been widely employed for describing the generation of action potentials. In this paper, we begin with a biological interpretation of what the subsequent mathematical and numerical analyses of the model entail. The interaction between action potential variable and recovery variable is then revisited through linear stability analysis around the equilibrium and local stability conditions are determined. Analytical results are compared with numerical simulations. The study aims to show an alternative approach regarding Taylor polynomials and constructed difference scheme which play a key role in the numerical approach for the problem. The robustness of the schemes is investigated in terms of convergency and stability of the techniques. This systematic approach by the combination of numerical techniques provides beneficial results which are uniquely designed for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. We describe the matrix representations with the collocation points. Then the method is applied in order to acquire a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. On the other hand, we apply finite difference scheme and its stability is also performed. Moreover, the numerical simulations are shown. Consequently, a comprehensive investigation of the related model is examined.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.17967v1,"A fully adaptive, high-order, fast Poisson solver for complex two-dimensional geometries",Daniel Fortunato; David B. Stein; Alex H. Barnett,"We present a new framework for the fast solution of inhomogeneous elliptic boundary value problems in domains with smooth boundaries. High-order solvers based on adaptive box codes or the fast Fourier transform can efficiently treat the volumetric inhomogeneity, but require care to be taken near the boundary to ensure that the volume data is globally smooth. We avoid function extension or cut-cell quadratures near the boundary by dividing the domain into two regions: a bulk region away from the boundary that is efficiently treated with a truncated free-space box code, and a variable-width boundary-conforming strip region that is treated with a spectral collocation method and accompanying fast direct solver. Particular solutions in each region are then combined with Laplace layer potentials to yield the global solution. The resulting solver has an optimal computational complexity of $O(N)$ for an adaptive discretization with $N$ degrees of freedom. With an efficient two-dimensional (2D) implementation we demonstrate adaptive resolution of volumetric data, boundary data, and geometric features across a wide range of length scales, to typically 10-digit accuracy. The cost of all boundary corrections remains small relative to that of the bulk box code. The extension to 3D is expected to be straightforward in many cases because the strip ``thickens'' an existing boundary quadrature.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.17956v3,The Numerical Approximation of Caputo Fractional Derivative of Higher Orders Using A Shifted Gegenbauer Pseudospectral Method: Two-Point Boundary Value Problems of the Bagley Torvik Type Case Study,Kareem T. Elgindy,"This work presents a new framework for approximating Caputo fractional derivatives (FDs) of any positive order using a shifted Gegenbauer pseudospectral (SGPS) method. By transforming the Caputo FD into a scaled integral of the $m$th-derivative of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial (with $m$ being the ceiling of the fractional order $\alpha$), we mitigate the singularity near zero, improving stability and accuracy. The method links $m$th-derivatives of shifted Gegenbauer (SG) polynomials with SG polynomials of lower degrees, allowing for precise integration using SG quadratures. We employ orthogonal collocation and SG quadratures in barycentric form to obtain an accurate and efficient approach for solving fractional differential equations. We provide error analysis showing that the SGPS method is convergent in a semi-analytic framework and conditionally convergent with exponential rate for smooth functions in finite-precision arithmetic. This exponential convergence improves accuracy compared to wavelet-based, operational matrix, and finite difference methods. The SGPS method is flexible, with adjustable SG parameters for optimal performance. A key contribution is the fractional SG integration matrix (FSGIM), which enables efficient computation of Caputo FDs via matrix-vector multiplications and accelerates the SGPS method through pre-computation and storage. The method remains within double-precision limits, making it computationally efficient. It handles any positive fractional order $\alpha$ and outperforms existing schemes in solving Caputo fractional two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs) of the Bagley-Torvik type.",NA,NA,0,1

Evans; Kurt Maute,"Immersed finite element methods provide a convenient analysis framework for problems involving geometrically complex domains, such as those found in topology optimization and microstructures for engineered materials. However, their implementation remains a major challenge due to, among other things, the need to apply nontrivial stabilization schemes and generate custom quadrature rules. This article introduces the robust and computationally efficient algorithms and data structures comprising an immersed finite element preprocessing framework. The input to the preprocessor consists of a background mesh and one or more geometries defined on its domain. The output is structured into groups of elements with custom quadrature rules formatted such that common finite element assembly routines may be used without or with only minimal modifications. The key to the preprocessing framework is the construction of material topology information, concurrently with the generation of a quadrature rule, which is then used to perform enrichment and generate stabilization rules. While the algorithmic framework applies to a wide range of immersed finite element methods using different types of meshes, integration, and stabilization schemes, the preprocessor is presented within the context of the extended isogeometric analysis. This method utilizes a structured B-spline mesh, a generalized Heaviside enrichment strategy considering the material layout within individual basis functions$'$ supports, and face-oriented ghost stabilization. Using a set of examples, the effectiveness of the enrichment and stabilization strategies is demonstrated alongside the preprocessor$'$s robustness in geometric edge cases.

Medical microrobots could be injected into the bloodstream and magnetically navigated to the clot for administering the drugs directly to the target. The magnetic manipulation required to navigate medical microrobots will depend on various parameters such as the microrobots size, the blood velocity, and the imposed magnetic field gradients. Numerical simulation was used to study the motion of magnetically controlled microrobots flowing through representative cerebral bifurcations, for predicting the magnetic gradients required to navigate the microrobots from the injection point until the target location. Upon thorough validation of the model against several independent analytical and experimental results, the model was used to generate maps and a predictive equation providing quantitative information on the required magnetic gradients, for different scenarios.

It factorizes the matrix into the form LDLt using Jacobi rotations in order to increase the pivot's absolute value. Furthermore, Rook's pivoting strategy is also adapted and implemented. In determinate compatible systems, the computational cost of the algorithm was similar to the cost of the Bunch-Kaufman method, but the error was approximately 50 % smaller for intermediate and large matrices, regardless of the condition number of the coefficient matrix. Furthermore, unlike Bunch-Kaufman, the new algorithm calculates with little additional cost the fundamental basis of the null space, and obtains the minimal least squares and minimum norm solutions. In minimal least squares with minimum norm problems, the new algorithm was compared with the LAPACK Complete Orthogonal Decomposition algorithm, among others.

This combination provides the time and memory efficiency of H2 operator representation along with the rapid convergence of a multilevel method. We describe how H2MG works, show its linear complexity, and demonstrate its effectiveness on two standard kernels. The current zoo of H2 solvers, which includes a wide variety of iterative and direct solvers, so far lacks a method that exploits multiple levels of resolution, commonly referred to in the iterative methods literature as ``multigrid'' from its origins in a hierarchy of grids used to discretize differential equations.

This scheme is an alternative to the techniques proposed in Qiu and Shu (SIAM J Sci Comput 24(6):2185-2198, 2003) to obtain high-order accurate schemes using Weighted Essentially Non Oscillatory finite differences and approximating the flux derivatives required by the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure by simple centered finite differences. We analyse how errors in first-order terms near discontinuities propagate through both versions of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure. We propose a fluctuation control, for which the approximation of the first-order derivative to be used in the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure is obtained from a Weighted Essentially Non Oscillatory (WENO) interpolation of flux derivatives, instead of the usual finite difference of WENO flux reconstructions. The numerical results that we obtain confirm the benefits of this fluctuation control.",NA,NA,0,1

This approach is based on an approximate formulation of the Taylor methods that has a much easier implementation than the original Taylor methods, since only the functions in the ODEs, and not their derivatives, are needed, just as in classical Runge-Kutta schemes. Compared to Runge-Kutta methods, the number of function evaluations to achieve a given order is higher, however with the present procedure it is much easier to produce arbitrary high-order schemes, which may be important in some applications. In many cases the new approach leads to an asymptotically lower computational cost when compared to the Taylor expansion based on exact derivatives.

2501.17438v1,Unfitted finite element interpolated neural networks,Wei Li; Alberto F.

Easy-to-generate background meshes (e.g., a simple Cartesian mesh) that cut the domain boundary (i.e., they do not conform to it) are used to build suitable trial and test finite element spaces. The method seeks a neural network that, when interpolated onto the trial space, minimises a discrete dual norm (defined over the test space) of the weak residual functional associated to the equation. As with unfitted finite elements, essential boundary conditions are weakly imposed by Nitsche's method. The method is robust to variations in Nitsche coefficient values, and to small cut cells. We experimentally demonstrate the method's effectiveness in solving both forward and inverse problems across various 2D and 3D complex geometries, including those defined by implicit level-set functions and explicit stereolithography meshes. For forward problems with smooth analytical solutions, the trained neural networks achieve several orders of magnitude smaller $H^1$ errors compared to their interpolation counterparts. These interpolations also maintain expected $h$- and $p$-convergence rates. Moreover, using preconditioners (achieved by stabilisations) remarkably accelerates neural network training and further enhances robustness to the choice of Nitsche coefficient values. The experiments also show the method's high accuracy and reliability in solving inverse problems, even with incomplete observations.",NA,NA,0,1

Our main tool is a sub-additive property of Mittag-Leffler function and its optimal asymptotic decay rate estimation. Our results further optimize and improve some existing results in the literature. We illustrate two significant applications of this fractional Halanay-type inequality. Firstly, by combining our results in this work with the positive representation method positive representation of delay differential systems, we establish an asymptotic stability criterion for a category of linear fractional coupled systems with bounded delays. This criterion extends beyond the traditional boundaries of positive system theory, offering a new perspective on stability analysis in this domain. Secondly, through energy estimation, we establish the contractility and dissipativity of a class of time fractional neutral functional differential equations. Our analysis reveals the typical long-term polynomial decay behavior inherent in time fractional evolutionary equations, thereby providing a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent numerical investigations.",NA,NA,0,1

We generalize our recent semi-implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration framework for gray TRT to multifrequency TRT, and also introduce a semi-implicit variation that facilitates higher-order integration of TRT, where each stage is implicit in all components except opacities. To appeal to the broad literature on adaptivity with Runge--Kutta methods, we derive new embedded methods for four asymptotic preserving IMEX Runge--Kutta schemes we have found to be robust in our previous work on TRT and radiation hydrodynamics. We then use a moment-based high-order-low-order representation of the transport equations. Due to the high dimensionality, memory is always a concern in simulating TRT. We form error estimates and adaptivity in time purely based on temperature and radiation energy, for a trivial overhead in computational cost and memory usage compared with the base second order integrators. We then test the adaptivity in time on the tophat and Larsen problem, demonstrating the ability of the adaptive algorithm to naturally vary the timestep across 4--5 orders of magnitude, ranging from the dynamical timescales of the streaming regime to the thick diffusion limit.",NA,NA,0,1

These samples are then processed using functional hierarchical tensor sketching, a tensor-network-based density estimation method for high-dimensional distributions, to obtain the numerical representation of the Gibbs distribution.

2501.17110v2,Solving Roughly Forced Nonlinear PDEs via Misspecified Kernel Methods and Neural Networks,Ricardo Baptista; Edoardo Calvello; Matthieu Darcy; Houman Owhadi; Andrew M. Stuart; Xianjin Yang,"We consider the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) or Neural Networks (NNs) to numerically approximate the solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with rough forcing or source terms, which commonly arise as pathwise solutions to stochastic PDEs. Kernel methods have recently been generalized to solve nonlinear PDEs by approximating their solutions as the maximum a posteriori estimator of GPs that are conditioned to satisfy the PDE at a finite set of collocation points. The convergence and error guarantees of these methods, however, rely on the PDE being defined in a classical sense and its solution possessing sufficient regularity to belong to the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose a generalization of these methods to handle roughly forced nonlinear PDEs while preserving convergence guarantees with an oversmoothing GP kernel that is misspecified relative to the true solution's regularity. This is achieved by conditioning a regular GP to satisfy the PDE with a modified source term in a weak sense (when integrated against a finite number of test functions). This is equivalent to replacing the empirical $L^2$-loss on the PDE constraint by an empirical negative-Sobolev norm. We further show that this loss function can be used to extend physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to stochastic equations, thereby resulting in a new NN-based variant termed Negative Sobolev Norm-PINN (NeS-PINN).",NA,NA,0,1

The original approach in Qiu and Shu (2003) uses the exact expressions of the fluxes and their derivatives whereas the new procedure computes suitable finite difference approximations of them ensuring arbitrarily high order accuracy both in space and time as the original technique does, with a much simpler implementation and generically better performance, since only flux evaluations are required and no symbolic computations of flux derivatives are needed.",NA,NA,0,1

In this paper we present a new weighted extrapolation technique which entails an improvement with respect to the technique that was developed in [1]. This technique is based on the application of a variant of the Lagrange extrapolation through the computation of weights capable of detecting regions with discontinuities.

2501.17019v1,Adaptive multipliers for extrapolation in frequency,Diego Castelli Lacunza; Carlos A. Sing Long,"Resolving the details of an object from coarse-scale measurements is a classical problem in applied mathematics. This problem is usually formulated as extrapolating the Fourier transform of the object from a bounded region to the entire space, that is, in terms of performing extrapolation in frequency. This problem is ill-posed unless one assumes that the object has some additional structure. When the object is compactly supported, then it is well-known that its Fourier transform can be extended to the entire space. However, it is also well-known that this problem is severely ill-conditioned.   In this work, we assume that the object is known to belong to a collection of compactly supported functions and, instead performing extrapolation in frequency to the entire space, we study the problem of extrapolating to a larger bounded set using dilations in frequency and a single Fourier multiplier. This is reminiscent of the refinement equation in multiresolution analysis. Under suitable conditions, we prove the existence of a worst-case optimal multiplier over the entire collection, and we show that all such multipliers share the same canonical structure. When the collection is finite, we show that any worst-case optimal multiplier can be represented in terms of an Hermitian matrix. This allows us to introduce a fixed-point iteration to find the optimal multiplier. This leads us to introduce a family of multipliers, which we call $\Sigma$-multipliers, that can be used to perform extrapolation in frequency. We establish connections between $\Sigma$-multipliers and multiresolution analysis. We conclude with some numerical experiments illustrating the practical consequences of our results.",NA,NA,0,1

We approximate an incoming wave boundary condition in such a way that the resulting schemes are compatible with a time-harmonic / transient decomposition of the solution, which allows us to establish their long-time stability. This approach readily applies to curvilinear and complex domains. We perform a numerical study of these schemes which compares their cost and accuracy against a standard Crank-Nicolson time integrator, and we run realistic simulations where the long-term behaviour is assessed using frequency-domain solutions.

In general, the family of AT1 functionals showcases a well-defined elastic limit and narrow transition regions before crack onset, as opposed to AT2 models. On the other hand, high-order functionals provide similar accuracy as low-order ones but allow for larger mesh sizes in their discretization, remarkably reducing the computational cost. In this work, we aim to combine both these advantages and propose a novel AT1 fourth-order phase-field model for brittle fracture within an isogeometric framework, which provides a straightforward discretization of the high-order term in the crack surface density functional. For the introduced AT1 functional, we first prove a {\Gamma}-convergence result (in both the continuum and discretized isogeometric setting) based on a careful study of the optimal transition profile, which ultimately provides the explicit correction factor for the toughness and the exact size of the transition region. Fracture irreversibility is modeled by monotonicity of the damage variable and is conveniently enforced using the Projected Successive Over-Relaxation algorithm. Our numerical results indicate that the proposed fourth-order AT1 model is more accurate than the considered lower-order AT1 and AT2 models; this allows to employ larger mesh sizes, entailing a lower computational cost.",NA,NA,0,1

Even though the classical centred scheme is well-known, it is the first time that such sharp estimates of absolute and relative errors are obtained.

The proposed ghost-penalty operator is straightforward to implement, ensures algebraic stability, provides an implicit extension of the solution beyond the physical domain, and stabilizes the numerical method for problems dominated by transport phenomena. This paper presents both a sharp interface version of the method and an alternative diffuse interface formulation designed to avoid integration over implicitly defined embedded surfaces. A complete numerical analysis of the sharp interface version is provided. The results of several numerical experiments support the theoretical analysis and illustrate the performance of both variants of the method.",NA,NA,0,1

The principle states that the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix sum is controlled by the minimum eigenvalue of a Gaussian random matrix that inherits its statistics from the summands. This methodology is powerful because of the vast arsenal of tools for treating Gaussian random matrices. As applications, the paper presents short, conceptual proofs of some old and new results in high-dimensional statistics. It also settles a long-standing open question in computational linear algebra about the injectivity properties of very sparse random matrices.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.16529v1,An artificial viscosity approach to high order entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods,Jesse Chan,"Entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods improve the robustness of high order DG simulations of nonlinear conservation laws. These methods yield a semi-discrete entropy inequality, and rely on an algebraic flux differencing formulation which involves both summation-by-parts (SBP) discretization matrices and entropy conservative two-point finite volume fluxes. However, explicit expressions for such two-point finite volume fluxes may not be available for all systems, or may be computationally expensive to compute.   This paper proposes an alternative approach to constructing entropy stable DG methods using an artificial viscosity coefficient based on the local violation of a cell entropy inequality and the local entropy dissipation. The resulting method recovers the same global semi-discrete entropy inequality that is satisfied by entropy stable flux differencing DG methods. The artificial viscosity coefficients are parameter-free and locally computable over each cell, and the resulting artificial viscosity preserves both high order accuracy and a hyperbolic maximum stable time-step size under explicit time-stepping.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.16248v1,Nodal AMG Coarsening and Interpolation for PDE Systems,James Brannick; Robert Falgout; Karsten Kahl; Jacob Schroder; Taoli Shen,"We present an approach to constructing a practical coarsening algorithm and interpolation operator for the algebraic multigrid (AMG) method, tailored towards systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) with large near-kernels, such as H(curl) and H(div). Our method builds on compatible relaxation (CR) and the ideal interpolation model within the generalized AMG (GAMG) framework but introduces several modifications to define an AMG method for PDE systems. We construct an interpolation operator through a coarsening process that first coarsens a nodal dual problem and then builds the coarse and fine variables using a matching algorithm. Our interpolation follows the ideal formulation; however, we enhance the sparsity of ideal interpolation by decoupling the fine and coarse variables completely. When the coarse variables align with the geometric refinement, our method reproduces re-discretization on unstructured meshes. Together with an automatic smoother construction scheme that identifies the local near kernels, our approach forms a complete two-grid method. Finally, we also show numerical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of this interpolation scheme by applying it to targeted problems and the Stokes system.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.16194v1,3D image based stochastic micro-structure modelling of foams for simulating elasticity,Anne Jung; Claudia Redenbach; Katja Schladitz; Sarah Staub,"Image acquisition techniques such as micro-computed tomography are nowadays widely available. Quantitative analysis of the resulting 3D image data enables geometric characterization of the micro-structure of materials. Stochastic geometry models can be fit to the observed micro-structures. By alteration of the model parameters, virtual micro-structures with modified geometry can be generated. Numerical simulation of elastic properties in realizations of these models yields deeper insight on the influence of particular micro-structural features. Ultimately, this allows for an optimization of the micro-structure geometry for particular applications. Here, we present this workflow at the example of open cell foams. Applicability is demonstrated using an aluminum alloy foam sample. The structure observed in a micro-computed tomography image is modeled by the edge system of a random Laguerre tessellation generated by a system of closely packed spheres. Elastic moduli are computed in the binarized micro-CT image of the foam as well as in realizations of the model.

However, most approaches require the motion to be known in advance so that it can be included in the space-time mesh. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes to use the well-known air-gap element for the rotor-stator coupling of an isogeometric machine model. First, we derive the solution in the air-gap region and then employ it to couple the rotor and stator. This coupling is angle dependent and we show how to efficiently update the coupling matrices to a different angle, avoiding expensive quadrature. Finally, the resulting time-dependent problem is solved in a space-time setting. The spatial discretization using isogeometric analysis is particularly suitable for coupling via the air-gap element, as NURBS can exactly represent the geometry of the air-gap. Furthermore, the model including the air-gap element can be seamlessly transferred to the space-time setting. However, the air-gap element is well known in the literature.

The proposed method maintains a simple, symmetric, and positive definite formulation. It achieves optimal error estimates for the exact solution in a discrete norm, as well as an optimal-order $L^2$ error estimate for $k>2$ and a sub-optimal order for the lowest order case $k=2$.

Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems.

Machine learning can accelerate this process, but struggle with weak generalizability, interpretability, and data dependency, as well as suffer in long-term prediction. To this end, we propose a PDE-embedded network with multiscale time stepping (MultiPDENet), which fuses the scheme of numerical methods and machine learning, for accelerated simulation of flows. In particular, we design a convolutional filter based on the structure of finite difference stencils with a small number of parameters to optimize, which estimates the equivalent form of spatial derivative on a coarse grid to minimize the equation's residual. A Physics Block with a 4th-order Runge-Kutta integrator at the fine time scale is established that embeds the structure of PDEs to guide the prediction. To alleviate the curse of temporal error accumulation in long-term prediction, we introduce a multiscale time integration approach, where a neural network is used to correct the prediction error at a coarse time scale. Experiments across various PDE systems, including the Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrate that MultiPDENet can accurately predict long-term spatiotemporal dynamics, even given small and incomplete training data, e.g., spatiotemporally down-sampled datasets. MultiPDENet achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other neural baseline models, also with clear speedup compared to classical numerical methods.",NA,NA,0,1

We prove results for fixed polynomial degree (in both the fine and coarse spaces), as well as for polynomial degree increasing like $\log k$. In the latter case, we exhibit choices of fine and coarse spaces such that, modulo factors of $\log k$, the fine and coarse spaces are both pollution free (with the ratio of the coarse-space dimension to the fine-space dimension arbitrarily small), the number of degrees of freedom per subdomain is constant, and the number of GMRES iterations is constant; i.e., modulo the important question of how to efficiently solve the coarse problem, this is the (arguably) theoretically ideal situation.   Along with the results in the companion paper [Galkowski, Spence, arXiv:2501.11060] (which cover only fixed polynomial degree), these are the first rigorous convergence results about a two-level Schwarz preconditioner applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz equation with a coarse space that does not consist of problem-adapted basis functions.",NA,NA,0,1

To this end we discuss space-homogeneous Boltzmann-type equations, employing a non intrusive Monte Carlo approach both on the physical space, to solve the kinetic equation, and on the stochastic space, to investigate the uncertainty. To address the high dimensional challenges posed by this coupling, control variate approaches such as multi-fidelity and multi-level Monte Carlo methods are particularly effective. While both methods leverage models of varying accuracy to reduce computational demands, multi-fidelity methods exploit differences in model fidelity, while multi-level methods utilize a hierarchy of discretizations. Numerical simulations indicate that these approaches provide substantial accuracy improvements over standard Monte Carlo methods.

Roughly speaking, in their most basic form, ANNs can be regarded as functions that consist of a series of compositions of affine-linear functions with multidimensional versions of so-called activation functions. One of the most popular of such activation functions is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function $\mathbb{R} \ni x \mapsto \max\{ x, 0 \} \in \mathbb{R}$. The ReLU function is, however, not differentiable and, typically, this lack of regularity transfers to the cost function of the supervised learning problem under consideration. Regardless of this lack of differentiability issue, deep learning practioners apply SGD methods based on suitably generalized gradients in standard deep learning libraries like {\sc TensorFlow} or {\sc Pytorch}. In this work we reveal an accurate and concise mathematical description of such generalized gradients in the training of deep fully-connected feedforward ANNs and we also study the resulting generalized gradient function analytically. Specifically, we provide an appropriate approximation procedure that uniquely describes the generalized gradient function, we prove that the generalized gradients are limiting Fr\'echet subgradients of the cost functional, and we conclude that the generalized gradients must coincide with the standard gradient of the cost functional on every open sets on which the cost functional is continuously differentiable.",NA,NA,0,1

2501.15314v1,The immersed boundary method: an accelerated SIMPLE approach for moving bodies,Rachel Yovel; Eran Treister; Yuri Feldman,"We present a novel and scalable approach to accelerate a direct-forcing IBM for moving boundary simulations. Building upon the SIMPLE approach, we keep the pressure and forces coupled, formulate the pressure-forces corrections system, solve for pressure-forces corrections, then perform a projection-correction step for velocities followed by a correction step for pressure and forces. To solve the pressure-forces system, we apply a block reduction and suggest an efficient preconditioning approach that is based on using the Laplacian as a preconditioner for the resulting Schur complement. The Laplacian, being independent of the coordinates of the immersed body, is factorized only once (using an efficient direct method) and is then reused throughout the simulation. We present a rigorous proof of the spectral equivalence of the Laplacian and the Schur complement, thereby showing that the preconditioner's efficiency is independent of the grid resolution.   The performance of the method is validated through simulations of the flow around a periodically oscillating sphere in a three-dimensional box. The methodology is then applied to analyze flows generated by arrays of 7 and 14 sub-spheres modeling porous spheres of different porosities. We show good scalability of the algorithm in terms of computational time and memory consumptions. That is, the iteration count for the preconditioned pressure-forces system is nearly constant, regardless of the grid resolution, Reynolds number, and the number of spheres.

Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization. In its simplest form, SQM considers states in the form of unitary operators, where the quadratic constraints are conditions of unitarity. In this case, the stationary SQM problem is a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The SQM stationary problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The SQM non-stationary problem considers the evolution of a quantum system, distinct from the explicit time dependence of the Hamiltonian, $H(t)$. Several options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered, and quantum circuits of 2D type are introduced, which transform one quantum system into another. Although no known physical process currently describes such dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithm.

2501.15126v1,Fully-Automated Code Generation for Efficient Computation of Sparse Matrix Permanents on GPUs,Deniz Elbek; Kamer Kaya,"Registers are the fastest memory components within the GPU's complex memory hierarchy, accessed by names rather than addresses. They are managed entirely by the compiler through a process called register allocation, during which the compiler attempts to cache predictable data from thread-local memory into thread-private registers. Computing the permanent of a sparse matrix poses a challenge for compilers, as optimizing this process is hindered by the unpredictable distribution of nonzero elements, which only become known at runtime. In this work, we employ fully-automated code generation to address this, producing highly optimized kernels tailored to the matrix's sparsity pattern. State-of-the-art permanent computation algorithms require each thread to store a private array, denoted x, of size n. We first propose a technique that fully stores these arrays in registers, with inclusion and exclusion kernels generated for each column. To minimize control divergence and reduce the number of unique kernels within a warp, we exploit the internal structure of Gray codes, which are also used in the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our second technique reduces register pressure by utilizing both registers and global memory and introduces a matrix ordering and partitioning strategy for greater efficiency. On synthetic matrices, this approach achieves a 31x speedup over state-of-the-art CPU implementations on 112 cores, and an 8x speedup compared to our traditional GPU implementation.

Realizations of such a framework are faced with several challenges that stem from the extreme scale of forward models and, in some cases, slow eigenvalue decay of the parameter-to-observable map. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to overcome these challenges by exploiting the autonomous structure of the forward model. As a result, we can move the PDE solutions, which dominate the cost for solving the Bayesian inverse problem, to an offline computation and leverage the high-performance dense linear algebra capabilities of GPUs to accelerate the online prediction of quantities of interest. We seek to apply this framework to construct digital twins for the Cascadia subduction zone as a means of providing early warning for tsunamis generated by subduction zone megathrust earthquakes. To that end, we demonstrate how our methodology can be used to employ seafloor pressure observations, along with the coupled acoustic-gravity wave equations, to infer the earthquake-induced seafloor motion (discretized with $O(10^9)$ parameters) and forward predict the tsunami propagation. We present results of an end-to-end inference, prediction, and uncertainty quantification for a representative test problem for which this goal-oriented Bayesian inference is accomplished in real time, that is, in a matter of seconds.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.14895v1,"Data assimilation in 2D nonlinear coupled sound and heat flow, using a stabilized explicit finite difference scheme marched backward in time",Alfred S. Carasso,"This paper considers the ill-posed data assimilation problem associated with hyperbolic/parabolic systems describing 2D coupled sound and heat flow. Given hypothetical data at time T > 0, that may not correspond to an actual solution of the dissipative system at time T, initial data at time t = 0 are sought that can evolve, through the dissipative system, into a useful approximation to the desired data at time T. That may not always be possible. A stabilized explicit finite difference scheme, marching backward in time, is developed and applied to nonlinear examples in non rectangular regions. Stabilization is achieved by applying a compensating smoothing operator at each time step, to quench the instability. Analysis of convergence is restricted to the transparent case of linear, autonomous, selfadjoint spatial differential operators. However, the actual computational scheme can be applied to more general problems. Data assimilation is illustrated using 512x512 pixel images. Such images are associated with highly irregular non smooth intensity data that severely challenge ill-posed reconstruction procedures. Successful and unsuccessful examples are presented.",NA,NA,0,1

Vladar,"A non iterative direct blind deconvolution procedure, previously used successfully to sharpen Hubble Space Telescope imagery, is now found useful in sharpening nanoscale scanning electron microscope (SEM) and helium ion microscope (HIM) images. The method is restricted to images $g(x,y)$, whose Fourier transforms $\hat{g}(\xi,\eta)$ are such that $log~|\hat{g}(\xi,0)|$ is globally monotone decreasing and convex. The method is not applicable to defocus blurs. A point spread function in the form of a Linnik probability density function is postulated, with parameters obtained by least squares fitting the Fourier transform of the preconditioned microscopy image. Deconvolution is implemented in slow motion by marching backward in time, in Fourier space, from $t = 1$ to $t = 0$, in an associated logarithmic diffusion equation. Best results are usually found in a partial deconvolution at time $\bar{t}$, with $0 < \bar{t} < 1$, rather than in total deconvolution at $t=0$. The method requires familarity with microscopy images, as well as interactive search for optimal parameters.",NA,NA,0,1

Using data from as few as one high-fidelity simulation, the proposed method produces models generalizable under changes to boundary geometry by using solutions to elliptic boundary value problems over the flow domain as the model input, instead of Cartesian coordinates of the domain. Training data is generated through pointwise evaluation of flow features at points selected through a quad-tree adaptive sampling method to concentrate training points in areas with large field gradients. Models are trained within a training window around the body, while predictions are smoothly extended to freestream conditions using a Partition-of-Unity extension. Predictive capabilities of the machine learning model are demonstrated in steady-state flow of incompressible fluid around a cylinder and a Joukowski airfoil. The predicted flow field is used to warm-start CFD simulations to achieve acceleration in solver convergence.",NA,NA,0,1

The implementation of theoretical processes highlighted the necessity of providing theoretical frameworks for the convergence and error estimate analysis to support the experimental setups. In this paper, we establish new techniques for deriving quantitative estimates for the order of approximation for multivariate linear operators of the pointwise-type, with respect to the $L^p$-norm and to the so-called dissimilarity index defined through the continuous SSIM. In particular, we consider a family of approximation operators known as neural network (NN) operators, that have been widely studied in the last years in view of their connection with the theory of artificial neural networks. For these operators, we first establish sharp estimates in case of $C^1$ and piecewise (everywhere defined) $C^1$-functions. Then, the case of functions modeling digital images is considered, and specific quantitative estimates are achieved, including those with respect to the mentioned dissimilarity index. Moreover, the above analysis has also been extended to $L^p$-spaces, using a new constructive technique, in which the multivariate averaged modulus of smoothness has been employed. Finally, numerical experiments of image resizing have been given to support the theoretical results. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated through similarity indexes such as SSIM, likelihood index (S-index) and PSNR, and compared with other rescaling methods, including bilinear, bicubic, and upscaling-de la Vall\'ee-Poussin interpolation (u-VPI). Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method for image processing tasks, particularly in terms of the aforementioned SSIM, and are consistent with the provided theoretical analysis.",NA,NA,0,1

Moura; Siiri Rautio; Melody Alsaker; Rashmi Murthy; Matti Lassas; Samuli Siltanen,"Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method for recovering the internal conductivity of a physical body from electric boundary measurements. EIT combined with machine learning has shown promise for the classification of strokes. However, most previous works have used raw EIT voltage data as network inputs. We build upon a recent development which suggested the use of special noise-robust Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection (VHED) functions as network inputs, although that work used only highly simplified and mathematically ideal models. In this work we strengthen the case for the use of EIT, and VHED functions especially, for stroke classification. We design models with high detail and mathematical realism to test the use of VHED functions as inputs. Virtual patients are created using a physically detailed 2D head model which includes features known to create challenges in real-world imaging scenarios. Conductivity values are drawn from statistically realistic distributions, and phantoms are afflicted with either hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes of various shapes and sizes. Simulated noisy EIT electrode data, generated using the realistic Complete Electrode Model (CEM) as opposed to the mathematically ideal continuum model, is processed to obtain VHED functions. We compare the use of VHED functions as inputs against the alternative paradigm of using raw EIT voltages. Our results show that (i) stroke classification can be performed with high accuracy using 2D EIT data from physically detailed and mathematically realistic models, and (ii) in the presence of noise, VHED functions outperform raw data as network inputs.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

To balance the model accuracy and cost, the proposed method divides the analysis domain into three regions: near-body, wake and off-body. An approach based on a convolutional neural network is introduced as an efficient method to predict the downstream wake development. The model training only requires data from a single simulation, and its use is demonstrated to be effective in accelerating the RANS simulation when combined with an accurate flow prediction in the near-body region. The simulation using the proposed method took 26.3x fewer iterations, achieving 16.4x speedup in wall-clock time, compared to a baseline run using freestream initialization.",NA,NA,0,1

We consider a paired autoencoder framework, where two autoencoders are used to efficiently represent the input and target spaces separately and optimal mappings are learned between latent spaces, thus enabling forward and inverse surrogate mappings. We focus on interpretations using Bayes risk and empirical Bayes risk minimization, and we provide various theoretical results and connections to existing works on low-rank matrix approximations. Similar to end-to-end approaches, our paired approach creates a surrogate model for forward propagation and regularized inversion. However, our approach outperforms existing approaches in scenarios where training data for unsupervised learning are readily available but training pairs for supervised learning are scarce. Furthermore, we show that cheaply computable evaluation metrics are available through this framework and can be used to predict whether the solution for a new sample should be predicted well.",NA,NA,0,1

The proposed method is particularly effective when the position of an isolated discontinuity in the function and the jump in the function and its derivatives at that position are known. Traditional numerical integration rules are exact for polynomials of certain degree. However, they may not provide accurate results for piece-wise polynomials or functions with discontinuities without modifying the location and number of data points in the formula.

In the first part of this dissertation, we demonstrate that it is possible to design languages for forward error analysis with NumFuzz, a functional programming language whose type system expresses quantitative bounds on rounding error. This type system combines a sensitivity analysis, enforced through a linear typing discipline, with a novel graded monad to track the accumulation of rounding errors. We establish the soundness of the type system by relating the denotational semantics of the language to both an exact and floating-point operational semantics. To demonstrate the practical utility of NumFuzz as a tool for automated error analysis, we have developed a prototype implementation capable of automatically inferring error bounds. Our implementation produces bounds competitive with existing tools, while often achieving significantly faster analysis times. In the second part of this dissertation, we explore a type-based approach to backward error analysis with Bean, a first-order programming language with a linear type system that can express quantitative bounds on backward error. Bean's type system combines a graded coeffect system with strict linearity to soundly track the flow of backward error through programs. To illustrate Bean's potential as a practical tool for automated backward error analysis, we implement a variety of standard algorithms from numerical linear algebra in Bean, establishing fine-grained backward error bounds via typing in a compositional style. We also develop a prototype implementation of Bean that infers backward error bounds automatically.

A set-valued function can be continuous and yet have points where the topology of the image sets changes. The main challenge in set-valued function approximation is to derive high-order approximations near these points. In a previous paper, we presented with Q. Muzaffar, an algorithm for approximating set-valued functions with 1D sets ($d=1$) as images, achieving high approximation order near points of topology change.

Bean's type system combines a graded coeffect system with strict linearity to soundly track the flow of backward error through programs. We prove the soundness of our system using a novel categorical semantics, where every Bean program denotes a triple of related transformations that together satisfy a backward error guarantee.

Yáñez,"The approximation of data is a fundamental challenge encountered in various fields, including computer-aided geometric design, the numerical solution of partial differential equations, or the design of curves and surfaces. Numerous methods have been developed to address this issue, providing good results when the data is continuous. Among these, the Moving Least Squares (MLS) method has proven to be an effective strategy for fitting data, finding applications in both statistics and applied mathematics. However, the presence of isolated discontinuities in the data can lead to undesirable artifacts, such as the Gibbs phenomenon, which adversely affects the quality of the approximation.   In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the Moving Least Squares method with the well-established non-linear Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) method. This combination aims to construct a non-linear operator that enhances the accuracy of approximations near discontinuities while maintaining the order of accuracy in smooth regions.

It generalizes Martingale optimal transport, and forms a hierarchy with the Hellinger and the Wasserstein metrics. We observe that certain classes of parabolic PDEs, among them the porous medium equation of exponent two, are formally semi-contractive metric gradient flows in the new distance. This observation is made rigorous for a suitable spatial discretization of the considered PDEs: these are semi-contractive gradient flows with respect to an adapted diffusive transport distance for measures on the point lattice. The main result is that the modulus of convexity is uniform with respect to the lattice spacing. Particularly for the quadratic porous medium equation, this is in contrast to what has been observed for discretizations of the Wasserstein gradient flow structure.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

Since few parameters of the Heston model can be directly extracted from real market data, calibration to real market data is implicit and therefore a challenging task. In addition, some of the parameters in the model are non-linear, which makes it difficult to find the global minimum of the optimization problem within the calibration. Our approach is based on the idea of space mapping, exploiting the residuum of a coarse surrogate model that allows optimization and a fine model that needs to be calibrated. In our case, the pricing of an Asian option using the Heston model SDE is the fine model, and the surrogate is chosen to be the Heston model PDE pricing a European option. We formally derive a gradient descent algorithm for the PDE constrained calibration model using well-known techniques from optimization with PDEs.

Specifically, we prove that the gradient flow training of a linear GNN with mean squared loss converges to the global minimum at an exponential rate. The convergence rate depends explicitly on the initial weights and the graph shift operator, which we validate on synthetic datasets from well-known graph models and real-world datasets.

Many numerical algorithms for this type of saddle points are based on the eigenvector-following idea and can be cast as an iterative minimization formulation (SINUM. Vol. 53, p.1786, 2015), but they may struggle with convergence issues and require good initial guesses. To address this challenge, we discuss the differential game interpretation of this iterative minimization formulation and investigate the relationship between this game's Nash equilibrium and saddle points on the potential energy surface. Our main contribution is that adding a proximal term, which grows faster than quadratic, to the game's cost function can enhance the stability and robustness. This approach produces a robust Iterative Proximal Minimization (IPM) algorithm for saddle point computing. We show that the IPM algorithm surpasses the preceding methods in robustness without compromising the convergence rate or increasing computational expense.

As an extension of the classical fluid equations, moment models are robust and have been frequently used, yet they are challenging to analyze due to their additional equations. By effectively grouping variables, we identify a 2-by-2 block structure, allowing the analysis of the well-posedness within the abstract LBB framework of saddle point problems. Due to the unique tensorial structure of the equations, in addition to an interesting combination of tools from Stokes' and linear elasticity theory, we also need new coercivity estimates for tensor fields. These Korn-type inequalities are established by analyzing the symbol map of the symmetric and trace-free part of tensor derivative fields.

It employs the use of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the computation of the basis functions and the Galerkin projection for the computation of the reduced coefficients. The main novelty of this work lies in the extension of the lifting function method, which typically is adopted for treating nonhomogeneous inlet velocity boundary conditions, to the handling of nonhomogeneous outlet boundary conditions for the pressure, representing a very delicate point in the numerical simulations of the cardiovascular system. Moreover, we incorporate a properly trained neural network in the ROM framework to approximate the mapping from the time parameter to the outflow pressure, which in the most general case is not available in closed form. We define our approach as ""hybrid"", because it merges physics-based elements with data-driven ones. At full order level, a Finite Volume method is employed for the discretization of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations while a two-element Windkessel model is adopted to enforce a valuable estimation of the outflow pressure.

The first algorithm, referred to as 3D discrete Radon transform (DRT) of planes, will compute the summation set of values lying in discrete planes in a cube that imitates, in discrete data, the integrals on two-dimensional planes in a 3D volume similar to the continuous Radon transform. The normals of these planes, equispaced in ascents, cover a quadrilateralized hemisphere and comprise 12 dodecants.   The second proposed algorithm, referred to as the 3D discrete John transform (DJT) of lines, will sum elements lying on discrete 3D lines while imitating the behavior of the John or X-ray continuous transform on 3D volumes.   These discrete integral transforms do not perform interpolation on input or intermediate data, and they can be computed using only integer arithmetics with linearithmic complexity; thus, outperforming the methods based on the Fourier slice-projection theorem for real-time applications.

They have desirable properties, such as unconditional stability or high-order accuracy. We first give a general description of the scheme for the scalar case (which corresponds to e.g. spring-mass interactions or pendulum motion), before extending the technique to the vector case (treating e.g. the $n$-body system).

The non-linear term has been controlled by Daftardar-Jafari polynomials. Our proposed technique is applied to several initial and boundary value problems and the obtained results are presented through graphs. The differing behavior of the solutions for the suggested problems is observed by using various fractional orders. It is found that our proposed technique has a high rate of convergence towards the exact solutions of the problems. Moreover, while implementing this modification, higher accuracy is achieved with a small number of calculations, which is the main novelty of the proposed technique.

More in detail, within the context of a generic Finite Volume (FV) semidiscretization, we consider Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization. The goal of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we want to demonstrate the possibility of utilizing very high order schemes in concrete situations and highlight the related advantages. On the other one, we want to debunk the myth according to which, in the context of numerical resolution of hyperbolic PDEs with very high order spatial discretizations, the adoption of lower order time discretizations, e.g., strong stability preserving (SSP) or linearly strong stability preserving ($\ell SSP$) Runge--Kutta (RK) schemes, does not affect the overall accuracy of the resulting approach and consequently its computational efficiency. Numerical results are reported for the linear advection equation (LAE) and for the Euler equations of fluid dynamics, showing the advantages and the critical aspects of the adoption of very high order numerical methods. Overall, the results indicate the potential for their use in real--life applications, offering advantages in terms of efficiency, such as requiring shorter computational times to achieve a prescribed error, even in problems involving discontinuities.

Specifically, the group difference map is defined using either the Cayley transform or the matrix exponential. The continuous and discrete Kelvin--Noether theorems are extended accordingly, that account for Kelvin--Noether quantities of the corresponding continuous and discrete Euler--Poincar\'e equations.

2501.12867v1,A function approximation algorithm using multilevel active subspaces,Fabio Nobile; Matteo Raviola; Raul Tempone,"The Active Subspace (AS) method is a widely used technique for identifying the most influential directions in high-dimensional input spaces that affect the output of a computational model. The standard AS algorithm requires a sufficient number of gradient evaluations (samples) of the input output map to achieve quasi-optimal reconstruction of the active subspace, which can lead to a significant computational cost if the samples include numerical discretization errors which have to be kept sufficiently small. To address this issue, we propose a multilevel version of the Active Subspace method (MLAS) that utilizes samples computed with different accuracies and yields different active subspaces across accuracy levels, which can match the accuracy of single-level AS with reduced computational cost, making it suitable for downstream tasks such as function approximation. In particular, we propose to perform the latter via optimally-weighted least-squares polynomial approximation in the different active subspaces, and we present an adaptive algorithm to choose dynamically the dimensions of the active subspaces and polynomial spaces. We demonstrate the practical viability of the MLAS method with polynomial approximation through numerical experiments based on random partial differential equations (PDEs).",NA,NA,0,1

Estimating the parameters of these systems from data is a challenging task, particularly when dealing with nonlinear and high-dimensional models. In this paper, we propose novel methodologies for parameter estimation in systems of ODEs by using the Newton-Raphson (NR) method and Gradient Descent (GD) method. By leveraging the discrete derivative and Taylor expansion, the problem is formulated in a way that enables the application of both methods, allowing for flexible, efficient solutions. Additionally, we extend these approaches to stochastic versions - Stochastic Newton-Raphson (SNR) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) - to handle large-scale systems with reduced computational cost. The proposed methods are evaluated by using numerical examples, including both linear and nonlinear parameter models, and compare the results to the well-known Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) method. While NR converges rapidly to the optimal solution, GD demonstrates robustness in handling chaotic systems, though it may occasionally lead to suboptimal results. Overall, the proposed methods provide improved accuracy in parameter estimation for ODE systems, outperforming NLS in terms of error metrics such as bias, mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination R2.

In this regime, a classical IMEX-RK approach involves an implicit coupling between the momentum and energy balance so as to avoid the acoustic CFL restriction, while the density can be treated in a fully explicit fashion. This approach leads to a mildly nonlinear equation for the pressure, which can be solved according to a fixed point procedure. An alternative strategy consists of employing a semi-implicit temporal integrator based on IMEX-RK methods (SI-IMEX-RK). The stiff dependence is carefully analyzed, so as to avoid the solution of a nonlinear equation for the pressure also for equations of state (EOS) of non-ideal gases. The spatial discretization is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which naturally allows high-order accuracy.

Kercher,"This paper concerns preservation of velocity and pressure equilibria in smooth, compressible, multicomponent flows in the inviscid limit. First, we derive the velocity-equilibrium and pressure-equilibrium conditions of a standard discontinuous Galerkin method that discretizes the conservative form of the compressible, multicomponent Euler equations. We show that under certain constraints on the numerical flux, the scheme is velocity-equilibrium-preserving. However, standard discontinuous Galerkin schemes are not pressure-equilibrium-preserving. Therefore, we introduce a discontinuous Galerkin method that discretizes the pressure-evolution equation in place of the total-energy conservation equation. Semidiscrete conservation of total energy, which would otherwise be lost, is restored via the correction terms of [Abgrall, J. Comput. Phys., 372, 2018, pp. 640-666] and [Abgrall et al., J. Comput. Phys., 453, 2022, 110955]. Since the addition of the correction terms prevents exact preservation of pressure and velocity equilibria, we propose modifications that then lead to a velocity-equilibrium-preserving, pressure-equilibrium-preserving, and (semidiscretely) energy-conservative discontinuous Galerkin scheme, although there are certain tradeoffs. Additional extensions are also introduced.

Approaches based on proper orthogonal decomposition have been widely investigated in the literature, but they usually rely on some \emph{a-priori} knowledge about the bifurcating model and lack any error estimation. On the other hand, standard certified reduced basis techniques fail to represent correctly the branching behavior, since the error estimator is no longer reliable. The main goal of the contribution is to overcome these limitations by introducing two novel algorithms: (i) the adaptive-greedy, detecting the bifurcation point starting from scarce information over the parametric space, and (ii) the deflated-greedy, certifying multiple coexisting branches simultaneously. The former approach takes advantage of the features of the reduced manifold to detect the bifurcation, while the latter exploits the deflation and continuation methods to discover the bifurcating solutions and enrich the reduced space. We test the two strategies for the Coanda effect held by the Navier-Stokes equations in a sudden-expansion channel.

2501.11981v1,The Adini finite element on locally refined meshes,Dietmar Gallistl,"This work introduces a locally refined version of the Adini finite element for the planar biharmonic equation on rectangular partitions with at most one hanging node per edge. If global continuity of the discrete functions is enforced, for such method there is some freedom in assigning the normal derivative degree of freedom at the hanging nodes. It is proven that the convergence order $h^2$ known for regular solutions and regular partitions is lost for any such choice, and that assigning the average of the normal derivatives at the neighbouring regular vertices is the only choice that achieves a superlinear order, namely $h^{3/2}$ on uniformly refined meshes. On adaptive meshes, the method behaves like a first-order scheme. Furthermore, the reliability and efficiency of an explicit residual-based error estimator are shown up to the best approximation of the Hessian by certain piecewise polynomial functions.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.11947v1,Modeling finite viscoelasticity based on the Green-Naghdi kinematic assumption and generalized strains,Ju Liu; Chongran Zhao; Jiashen Guan,"We propose a modeling framework for finite viscoelasticity, inspired by the kinematic assumption made by Green and Naghdi in plasticity. This approach fundamentally differs from the widely used multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, as the intermediate configuration, a concept that remains debated, becomes unnecessary. The advent of the concept of generalized strains allows the Green-Naghdi assumption to be employed with different strains, offering a flexible mechanism to separate inelastic deformation from total deformation. This leads to a constitutive theory in which the kinematic separation is adjustable and can be calibrated. For quadratic configurational free energy, the framework yields a suite of finite linear viscoelasticity models governed by linear evolution equations. Notably, these models recover established models, including those by Green and Tobolsky (1946) and Simo (1987), when the Seth-Hill strain is chosen with the strain parameter being -2 and 2, respectively. It is also related to the model of Miehe and Keck (2000) when the strain is of the Hencky type. We further extend the approach by adopting coercive strains, which allows us to define an elastic deformation tensor locally. This facilitates modeling the viscous branch using general forms of the configurational free energy, and we construct a micromechanical viscoelastic model as a representative instantiation. The constitutive integration algorithms of the proposed models are detailed. We employ the experimental data of VHB 4910 to examine the proposed models, which demonstrate their effectiveness and potential advantages in the quality of fitting and prediction. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is also conducted to assess the influence of different strains on the viscoelastic behavior.",NA,NA,0,1

In particular, we demonstrate that these schemes provide essential flexibility by removing inter-element continuity while also guaranteeing convergent approximations in the quasiconvex case. Notably, quasiconvexity is the weakest form of convexity pertinent to elasticity. Furthermore, we show that in the non-convex case discrete minimisers converge to minimisers of the relaxed problem. In this case, the minimisation problem corresponds to the energy defined by the quasiconvex envelope of the original energy. Our approach covers all discontinuous Galerkin formulations known to converge for convex energies. This work addresses an open challenge in the vectorial calculus of variations: developing and rigorously justifying numerical schemes capable of reliably approximating nonlinear energy minimization problems with potentially singular solutions, which are frequently encountered in materials science.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

We show the monotonic convergence of the two-step modified Newton method under mild assumptions. When the Jacobian of the nonlinear operator at the minimal positive solution is singular, we present a convergence analysis of the two-step modified Newton method in this context. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method yields comparable results to several existing Newton-type methods and that it brings a significant reduction in computation time for nearly singular and large-scale problems.",NA,NA,0,1

Specifically, for a three simplex immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the associated discrete Laplacian on the tetrahedron can be expressed as the discrete Laplacian of the faces of the tetrahedron and the associated discrete mean curvature term given by the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^3$. Based on geometric foundations, we provide a mathematical proof showing that the dual construction gives a optimal Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^3$ compared to the primal construction. Moreover, we show that the associated discrete mean curvature is more sensitive to the initial mesh than other state-of-the-art discrete mean curvatures when the angle changes instantaneously. Instead of improving the angular transient accuracy through mesh subdivision, we can improve the accuracy by providing a higher order approximation of the instantaneous change in angle to reduce the solution error.",NA,NA,0,1

Our model uses a phase field approach coupled to a Navier-Stokes equation describing the macroscopic movement of the fluid. Additionally, we incorporate the evaporation process of the solvent using an Allen-Cahn equation.   The model is discretized using a finite-element approach with a semi-implicit discretization in time. The resulting (non)linear systems are coupled and of large dimensionality. We present a preconditioned iterative scheme to solve them robustly with respect to changes in the discretization parameters. We illustrate that the preconditioned solver shows parameter-robust iteration numbers and that the model qualitatively captures the behavior of the film morphology during drying.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.11673v1,Randomized Kaczmarz Methods with Beyond-Krylov Convergence,Michał Dereziński; Deanna Needell; Elizaveta Rebrova; Jiaming Yang,"Randomized Kaczmarz methods form a family of linear system solvers which converge by repeatedly projecting their iterates onto randomly sampled equations. While effective in some contexts, such as highly over-determined least squares, Kaczmarz methods are traditionally deemed secondary to Krylov subspace methods, since this latter family of solvers can exploit outliers in the input's singular value distribution to attain fast convergence on ill-conditioned systems.   In this paper, we introduce Kaczmarz++, an accelerated randomized block Kaczmarz algorithm that exploits outlying singular values in the input to attain a fast Krylov-style convergence. Moreover, we show that Kaczmarz++ captures large outlying singular values provably faster than popular Krylov methods, for both over- and under-determined systems. We also develop an optimized variant for positive semidefinite systems, called CD++, demonstrating empirically that it is competitive in arithmetic operations with both CG and GMRES on a collection of benchmark problems. To attain these results, we introduce several novel algorithmic improvements to the Kaczmarz framework, including adaptive momentum acceleration, Tikhonov-regularized projections, and a memoization scheme for reusing information from previously sampled equation~blocks.",NA,NA,0,1

Andrews,"The Parker conjecture, which explores whether magnetic fields in perfectly conducting plasmas can develop tangential discontinuities during magnetic relaxation, remains an open question in astrophysics. Helicity conservation provides a topological barrier during relaxation, preventing topologically nontrivial initial data relaxing to trivial solutions; preserving this mechanism discretely over long time periods is therefore crucial for numerical simulation. This work presents an energy- and helicity-preserving finite element discretization for the magneto-frictional system, for investigating the Parker conjecture. The algorithm preserves a discrete version of the topological barrier and a discrete Arnold inequality. We also discuss extensions to domains with nontrivial topology.",NA,NA,0,1

More precisely, we prove a continuous dependence of the discrete solution on the data in a $C^0([0, T]; X)$-type energy norm, which does not require any restriction on the meshsize or the time steps. Such stability estimates are then used to derive a priori error estimates with quasi-optimal convergence rates, where a suitable treatment of possible nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions is pivotal to avoid loss of accuracy. Moreover, based on the properties of a postprocessed approximation, we derive a constant-free, reliable a posteriori error estimate in the $C^0([0, T]; L^2(\Omega))$-norm for the semidiscrete-in-time formulation.

Using the Chebyshev-Kolmogorov-Arnold network model applied to Sentinel-2 imagery, the extent of burned areas was mapped, ranging from 315.36 to 10,960.98 hectares. Our analysis revealed that shrubland ecosystems were consistently the most affected, comprising 57.4-75.8% of burned areas across all events. The jurisdictional assessment demonstrated varying management complexities, from singular authority (98.7% in the Palisades Fire) to distributed management across multiple agencies. A structural impact analysis revealed significant disparities between urban interface fires (Eaton: 9,869 structures; Palisades: 8,436 structures) and rural events (Kenneth: 24 structures; Hurst: 17 structures). The demographic analysis showed consistent gender distributions, with 50.9% of the population identified as female and 49.1% as male. Working-age populations made up the majority of the affected populations, ranging from 53.7% to 54.1%, with notable temporal shifts in post-fire periods. The study identified strong correlations between urban interface proximity, structural damage, and population exposure. The Palisades and Eaton fires affected over 20,000 people each, compared to fewer than 500 in rural events. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of targeted wildfire management strategies, particularly in wildland urban interface zones, and emphasize the need for age- and gender-conscious approaches in emergency response planning.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.11451v1,A Novel Interpretation of the Radon Transform's Ray- and Pixel-Driven Discretizations under Balanced Resolutions,Richard Huber,"Tomographic investigations are a central tool in medical applications, allowing doctors to image the interior of patients. The corresponding measurement process is commonly modeled by the Radon transform. In practice, the solution of the tomographic problem requires discretization of the Radon transform and its adjoint (called the backprojection). There are various discretization schemes; often structured around three discretization parameters: spatial-, detector-, and angular resolutions. The most widespread approach uses the ray-driven Radon transform and the pixel-driven backprojection in a balanced resolution setting, i.e., the spatial resolution roughly equals the detector resolution. The use of these particular discretization approaches is based on anecdotal reports of their approximation performance, but there is little rigorous analysis of these methods' approximation errors. This paper presents a novel interpretation of ray-driven and pixel-driven methods as convolutional discretizations, illustrating that from an abstract perspective these methods are similar. Moreover, we announce statements concerning the convergence of the ray-driven Radon transform and the pixel-driven backprojection under balanced resolutions. Our considerations are supported by numerical experiments highlighting aspects of the discussed methods.",NA,NA,0,1

This theory gives sufficient conditions for the preconditioned matrix to be close to the identity, and covers DD subdomains of arbitrary size, and arbitrary absorbing layers/boundary conditions on both the global and local Helmholtz problems. The assumptions on the coarse space are satisfied by the approximation spaces using problem-adapted basis functions that have been recently analysed as coarse spaces for the Helmholtz equation, as well as all spaces that are known to be quasi-optimal via a Schatz-type argument.

Unlike most classical references, the forward component is not only discretized by an Euler-Maruyama approximation but also by higher-order Taylor schemes. This includes the famous Milstein scheme, providing an improved strong convergence rate of order 1; and the simplified order 2.0 weak Taylor scheme exhibiting weak convergence rate of order 2. In order to have a fully-implementable scheme in case of these higher-order Taylor approximations, which involve the derivatives of the decoupling fields, we use the COS method built on Fourier cosine expansions to approximate the conditional expectations arising from the numerical approximation of the backward component. Even though higher-order numerical approximations for the backward equation are deeply studied in the literature, to the best of our understanding, the present numerical scheme is the first which achieves strong convergence of order 1 for the whole coupled system, including the forward equation, which is often the main interest in applications such as stochastic control.

Existing preconditioners such as Jacobi, Incomplete LU, and Algebraic Multigrid methods offer problem-specific advantages but rely heavily on hyperparameter tuning. Recent advances have explored using deep neural networks to learn preconditioners, though challenges such as misbehaved objective functions and costly training procedures remain. PEARL introduces a reinforcement learning approach for learning preconditioners, specifically, a contextual bandit formulation. The framework utilizes an actor-critic model, where the actor generates the incomplete Cholesky decomposition of preconditioners, and the critic evaluates them based on reward-specific feedback. To further guide the training, we design a dual-objective function, combining updates from the critic and condition number.

2501.10745v1,Changing the ranking in eigenvector centrality of a weighted graph by small perturbations,Michele Benzi; Nicola Guglielmi,"In this article, we consider eigenvector centrality for the nodes of a graph and study the robustness (and stability) of this popular centrality measure. For a given weighted graph $\G$ (both directed and undirected), we consider the associated weighted adiacency matrix $A$, which by definition is a non-negative matrix. Eigenvector centrality consists of ranking the elements of the graph according to the corresponding entries of the Perron eigenvector of $A$, which is associated with the positive eigenvalue with largest modulus.   An indicator of the robustness of eigenvector centrality consists in looking for a nearby perturbed graph $\widetilde{\G}$, with the same structure as $\G$ (i.e., with the same vertices and edges), but with a weighted adiacency matrix $\widetilde A$ such that the highest $m$ entries ($m \ge 2$) of the Perron eigenvector of $\widetilde A$ coalesce, making the ranking at the highest level ambiguous. To compute a solution to this matrix nearness problem, a nested iterative algorithm is proposed that makes use of a constrained gradient system of matrix differential equations (possibly on a low-rank manifold) in the inner iteration and a one-dimensional optimization of the perturbation size in the outer iteration.   The proposed algorithm produces the {\em optimal} perturbation (i.e., the one with smallest Frobenius norm) of the graph, which causes the looked-for coalescence, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the graph.

Since it is known that $C$ depends on the logarithmic norm of the Jacobian matrix associated with the neural ODE, we tune this parameter at our convenience by suitably perturbing the Jacobian matrix with a perturbation as small as possible in Frobenius norm. We do so by introducing an optimization problem for which we propose a nested two-level algorithm. For a given perturbation size, the inner level computes the optimal perturbation with a fixed Frobenius norm, while the outer level tunes the perturbation amplitude. We embed the proposed algorithm in the training of the neural ODE to improve its stability. Numerical experiments on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets show that an image classifier including a neural ODE in its architecture trained according to our strategy is more stable than the same classifier trained in the classical way, and therefore, it is more robust and less vulnerable to adversarial attacks.",NA,NA,0,1

However, they face significant challenges when applied to non-rectangular domains and in establishing theoretical convergence, particularly for high-order schemes. In this paper, we focus on solving the elliptic equation $-\nabla \cdot (a\nabla u)=f$ in a two-dimensional curved domain $\Omega$, where the diffusion coefficient $a$ is variable and smooth. We propose a sixth-order $9$-point compact FDM that only utilizes the grid points in $(h \mathbb{Z}^2)\cap \Omega$ for any mesh size $h>0$, without relying on ghost points or information outside $\overline{\Omega}$. All the boundary stencils near $\partial \Omega$ have at most $6$ different configurations and use at most $8$ grid points inside $\Omega$. We rigorously establish the sixth-order convergence of the numerically approximated solution $u_h$ in the $\infty$-norm. Additionally, we derive a gradient approximation $\nabla u$ directly from $u_h$ without solving auxiliary equations. This gradient approximation achieves proven accuracy of order $5+\frac{1}{q}$ in the $q$-norm for all $1\le q\le \infty$ (with a logarithmic factor $\log h$ for $1\le q<2$).

The worst-case root-convergence factor is derived for linear systems with $A$ being symmetric or $I-A$ being skew-symmetric. When $A$ is symmetric, the asymptotic convergence factor highly depends on the initial guess. While $M=I-A$ is skew-symmetric, GMRES(1) converges unconditionally and the worst-case root-convergence factor relies solely on the spectral radius of $M$. We also derive the q-linear convergence factor, which is the same as the worst-case root-convergence factor. Numerical experiments are presented to validate our theoretical results.",NA,NA,0,1

P. van der Meer,"In this paper, we present a surrogate-based multiscale approach to model constant strain-rate and creep experiments on unidirectional thermoplastic composites under off-axis loading. In previous contributions, these experiments were modeled through a single-scale micromechanical simulation under the assumption of macroscopic homogeneity. Although efficient and accurate in many scenarios, simulations with low-off axis angles showed significant discrepancies with the experiments. It was hypothesized that the mismatch was caused by macroscopic inhomogeneity, which would require a multiscale approach to capture it. However, full-field multiscale simulations remain computationally prohibitive. To address this issue, we replace the micromodel with a Physically Recurrent Neural Network (PRNN), a surrogate model that combines data-driven components with embedded constitutive models to capture history-dependent behavior naturally. The explainability of the latent space of this network is also explored in a transfer learning strategy that requires no re-training. With the surrogate-based simulations, we confirm the hypothesis raised on the inhomogeneity of the macroscopic strain field and gain insights into the influence of adjustment of the experimental setup with oblique end-tabs. Results from the surrogate-based multiscale approach show better agreement with experiments than the single-scale micromechanical approach over a wide range of settings, although with limited accuracy on the creep experiments, where macroscopic test effects were implicitly taken into account in the material properties calibration.",NA,NA,0,1

2501.10051v1,A Family of Controllable Momentum Coefficients for Forward-Backward Accelerated Algorithms,Mingwei Fu; Bin Shi,"Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (NAG) marks a pivotal advancement in gradient-based optimization, achieving faster convergence compared to the vanilla gradient descent method for convex functions. However, its algorithmic complexity when applied to strongly convex functions remains unknown, as noted in the comprehensive review by Chambolle and Pock [2016]. This issue, aside from the critical step size, was addressed by Li et al. [2024b], with the monotonic case further explored by Fu and Shi [2024]. In this paper, we introduce a family of controllable momentum coefficients for forward-backward accelerated methods, focusing on the critical step size $s=1/L$. Unlike traditional linear forms, the proposed momentum coefficients follow an $\alpha$-th power structure, where the parameter $r$ is adaptively tuned to $\alpha$. Using a Lyapunov function specifically designed for $\alpha$, we establish a controllable $O\left(1/k^{2\alpha} \right)$ convergence rate for the NAG-$\alpha$ method, provided that $r > 2\alpha$. At the critical step size, NAG-$\alpha$ achieves an inverse polynomial convergence rate of arbitrary degree by adjusting $r$ according to $\alpha > 0$. We further simplify the Lyapunov function by expressing it in terms of the iterative sequences $x_k$ and $y_k$, eliminating the need for phase-space representations. This simplification enables us to extend the controllable $O \left(1/k^{2\alpha} \right)$ rate to the monotonic variant, M-NAG-$\alpha$, thereby enhancing optimization efficiency. Finally, by leveraging the fundamental inequality for composite functions, we extended the controllable $O\left(1/k^{2\alpha} \right)$ rate to proximal algorithms, including the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA-$\alpha$) and its monotonic counterpart (M-FISTA-$\alpha$).",NA,NA,0,1

While $\varphi$-functions play a crucial role in the analysis and implementation of exponential integrators, their inverses arise in solving certain direct and inverse differential problems with non-local boundary conditions. We propose an adaptation of the standard scaling-and-squaring technique for computing $\psi_\ell(A)$, based on the Newton-Schulz iteration for matrix inversion. The convergence of this method is analyzed both theoretically and numerically. In addition, we derive and analyze Pad\'e approximants for approximating $\psi_1(A/2^s)$, where $s$ is a suitably chosen integer, necessary at the root of the squaring process.

O'Neill; Dongmian Zou; Jeff Calder; Gilad Lerman,"Generative modeling aims to generate new data samples that resemble a given dataset, with diffusion models recently becoming the most popular generative model. One of the main challenges of diffusion models is solving the problem in the input space, which tends to be very high-dimensional. Recently, solving diffusion models in the latent space through an encoder that maps from the data space to a lower-dimensional latent space has been considered to make the training process more efficient and has shown state-of-the-art results. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is the most commonly used encoder/decoder framework in this domain, known for its ability to learn latent representations and generate data samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel encoder/decoder framework with theoretical properties distinct from those of the VAE, specifically designed to preserve the geometric structure of the data distribution. We demonstrate the significant advantages of this geometry-preserving encoder in the training process of both the encoder and decoder. Additionally, we provide theoretical results proving convergence of the training process, including convergence guarantees for encoder training, and results showing faster convergence of decoder training when using the geometry-preserving encoder.",NA,NA,0,1

The test case is based on a compressible vertical slice model that can be obtained by simple modification of a standard three dimensional compressible dynamical core. On the one hand, an advantage of the test case is that is quasi-2D, so it can be run quickly on a standard workstation, enabling rapid experimentation with numerical schemes and discretisation choices. On the other hand, the test case exhibits frontogenesis, a challenging regime for numerical discretisations which usually only arises in 3D model configurations for the compressible case. Numerical results of the test case using an implicit time-stepping method with a compatible finite element discretisation are presented as a reference solution.

To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution.   In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix.

However, many of these processes show a random nature and contain uncertainties in the parameters. In this paper we extend the diffusive logistic model with unknown moving front to the random scenario by assuming that the involved parameters have a finite degree of randomness. The resulting mathematical model becomes a random free boundary partial differential problem and it is addressed numerically combining the finite difference method with two approaches for the treatment of the moving front. Firstly, we propose a front-fixing transformation, reshaping the original random free boundary domain into a fixed deterministic one. A second approach is using the front-tracking method to capture the evolution of the moving front adapted to the random framework. Statistical moments of the approximating solution stochastic process and the stochastic moving boundary solution are calculated by the Monte Carlo technique. Qualitative numerical analysis establishes the stability and positivity conditions.

Combined field integral equations are not affected by this spurious resonances but are essentially restricted to sufficiently smooth boundaries. For general Lipschitz domains, the latter integral equations are applicable through suitable regularization. Under fairly general assumptions on the regularizing operator, we propose {\sl a posterirori} computable error estimators for corresponding Galerkin boundary element methods of arbitrary polynomial degree. We show that adaptive mesh-refining algorithms steered by these local estimators converge at optimal algebraic rate with respect to the number of underlying boundary mesh elements.

The proposed finite element scheme is tested through the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) for static cases and dynamic simulations of simple mechanical scenarios.   Our computational experiments revealed energy dissipation, emphasizing the importance of exploring symplectic integrators in future work to impose energy conservation. Additionally, further research is required to verify temporal stability through time-domain MMS and to investigate complex mechanical scenarios, including those previously restrictive, challenging to simulate, or unfeasible with existing dynamic methods.

2501.08817v1,Multivariate Vector Subdivision Schemes with a General Matrix-valued Filter,Ran Lu,"Subdivision schemes are closely related to splines and wavelets and have numerous applications in CAGD and numerical differential equations. Subdivision schemes employ a scalar filter; that is, scalar subdivision schemes, have been extensively studied in the literature. In contrast, subdivision schemes with a matrix filter, which are the so-called vector subdivision schemes, are far from being well understood. So far, only vector subdivision schemes that use special matrix-valued filters have been well-investigated, such as the Lagrange and Hermite subdivision schemes. To the best of our knowledge, it remains unclear how to define and characterize the convergence of a vector subdivision scheme that uses a general matrix-valued filter. Though filters from Lagrange and Hermite subdivision schemes have nice properties and are widely used in practice, filters not from either subdivision scheme appear in many applications. Hence, it is necessary to study vector subdivision schemes with a general matrix-valued filter. In this paper, from the perspective of a vector cascade algorithm, we show that there is only one meaningful way to define a vector subdivision scheme. We will analyze the convergence of the newly defined vector subdivision scheme and show that it is equivalent to the convergence of the corresponding vector cascade algorithm. Applying our theory, we show that existing results on the convergence of Lagrange and Hermite subdivision schemes can be easily obtained and improved.

2501.08757v2,Transient Instability and Patterns of Reactivity in Diffusive-Chemotaxis Soil Carbon Dynamics,Fasma Diele; Deborah Lacitignola; Carmela Marangi; Angela Monti,"Pattern formation in diffusive-chemotaxis models has become increasingly important for understanding spatial structures in biological, ecological, and chemical systems. In soil, certain bacteria involved in the degradation of soil organic carbon (SOC) exhibit both motility and chemotactic behavior, as observed in experiments and field studies. To capture the formation of hot-spot soil aggregations resulting from bacterial and microorganism spatial organization, the spatially explicit MOMOS model incorporates chemotaxis into soil carbon dynamics, effectively describing the emergence of microbial aggregations and their impact on SOC dynamics. While classical studies on pattern formation primarily rely on asymptotic stability analysis, transient instability has emerged as a key mechanism for generating patterns in asymptotically stable systems. In this work, we investigate pattern formation outside the classical diffusive-chemotaxis-driven instability conditions by focusing on regions of parameter space associated with reactive equilibria. The MOMOS model for soil carbon dynamics serves as a case study to illustrate how transient behaviors can influence environmental dynamical systems. Using Klika's indicator, we estimate the maximum amplification and show that it provides a more accurate lower bound compared to the Kreiss constant. Furthermore, we explore the critical role of return time, showing that short return times suppress the emergence of stable reactive patterns. By employing the determinant of the linearized Jacobian as a proxy for return time, we identify a critical region near the instability boundary where multiple stable reactive patterns emerge.",NA,NA,0,1

Our technique for dealing with the singular maps is based on the regularization of the Riemannian metric tensor, and we detail how to implement this robustly. We investigate the method's behavior when applied to a square-to-cusp parameterization that allows us to vary the singular behavior's aggressiveness. We propose a scaling of the regularization parameter to obtain optimal order approximation.

SVD derivatives need to be computed efficiently to enable the large scale design optimization. However, for a general complex matrix, no method can accurately compute this derivative to machine precision and remain scalable with respect to the number of design variables without requiring the all of the singular variables. We propose two algorithms to efficiently compute this derivative based on the adjoint method and reverse automatic differentiation and RAD-based singular value derivative formula. Differentiation results for each method proposed were compared with FD results for one square and one tall rectangular matrix example and matched with the FD results to about 5 to 7 digits.

2501.08501v2,Scalable Bayesian Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,Zhiwei Gao; George Em Karniadakis,"Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a pivotal role in scientific machine learning, especially when surrogate models are used to approximate complex systems. Although multilayer perceptions (MLPs) are commonly employed as surrogates, they often suffer from overfitting due to their large number of parameters. Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer an alternative solution with fewer parameters. However, gradient-based inference methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), may result in computational inefficiency when applied to KANs, especially for large-scale datasets, due to the high cost of back-propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, combining the dropout Tikhonov ensemble Kalman inversion (DTEKI) with Chebyshev KANs. This gradient-free method effectively mitigates overfitting and enhances numerical stability. Additionally, we incorporate the active subspace method to reduce the parameter-space dimensionality, allowing us to improve the accuracy of predictions and obtain more reliable uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various test cases, including scenarios with large datasets and high noise levels. Our results show that the new method achieves comparable or better accuracy, much higher efficiency as well as stability compared to HMC, in addition to scalability.

The problem is mathematically modeled, and explicit analytical solutions are derived using Fourier techniques. A convergent finite difference scheme is also formulated to simulate specific cases. The solution is consistent with previous results. A numerical example is provided, demonstrating the coherence between the obtained results and the physical behavior of the problem. This work was recently published for a two-layer body; the generalization to m-layer bodies allows for conclusions that enhance the theoretical understanding of heat transfer in multilayer materials and may contribute to improving the thermal design of multilayer engineering systems.",AP_NA,AP;NA,1,1

The resulting surrogate-enhanced multilevel Monte Carlo methods reduce the cost of simulation by factors as large as $10^4$ compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations involving direct numerical solutions of the associated Grad-Shafranov partial differential equation. Accuracy assessments also show that surrogate-based sampling closely aligns with the results of direct computation, confirming its effectiveness in capturing the behavior of plasma boundary and geometric descriptors.",NA,NA,0,1

Miksis; Gillian Queisser,"The Fick-Jacobs equation is a classical model reduction of 3-dimensional diffusion in a tube of varying radius to a 1-dimensional problem with radially scaled derivatives. This model has been shown to be unstable when the radial gradient is too steep. In this work, we present a new derivation of the Fick-Jacobs equation that results in the addition of higher order spatial derivative terms that provide additional stability in a wide variety of cases and improved solution convergence.

Our AP loss demonstrates consistent stability concerning the small Knudsen number, ensuring the neural network solution uniformly converges to the macro solution.

2501.08006v2,BIAN: A Deep Learning Method to Solve Inverse Problems Using Only Boundary Information,Feng Chen; Kegan Li; Yiran Meng; Zhiyi Xiao; Pengqi Wu,"Over the past years, inverse problems in partial differential equations have garnered increasing interest among scientists and engineers. However, due to the lack of conventional stability, nonlinearity and non-convexity, these problems are quite challenging and difficult to solve. In this work, we propose a new kind of neural network to solve the coefficient identification problems with only the boundary information. In this work, three networks has been utilized as an approximator, a generator and a discriminator, respectively. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where the coefficients of interest have a complicated structure or are difficult to represent with traditional models. Comparative analysis against traditional coefficient estimation techniques demonstrates the superiority of our approach, not only handling highdimensional data and complex coefficient distributions adeptly by incorporating neural networks but also eliminating the necessity for extensive internal information due to the relationship between the energy distribution within the domain to the energy flux on the boundary. Several numerical examples have been presented to substantiate the merits of this algorithm including solving the Poisson equation and Helmholtz equation with spatially varying and piecewise uniform medium.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.07962v1,Rectangular polar quadrature in 1D and its error analysis,Krishna Yamanappa Poojara; Sabhrant Sachan; Ambuj Pandey,"This paper presents a one-dimensional analog of the Rectangular-Polar (RP) integration strategy and its convergence analysis for weakly singular convolution integrals. The key idea of this method is to break the whole integral into integral over non-overlapping patches (subdomains) and achieve convergence by increasing the number of patches while approximating the integral on patches accurately using a fixed number of quadrature points. The non-singular integrals are approximated to high-order using Fej\'er first quadrature, and a specialized integration strategy is designed and incorporated for singular integrals where the kernel singularity is resolved by mean of Polynomial Change of Variable (PCV). We prove that for high-order convergence, it is essential to compute integral weights accurately, and the method's convergence rate depends critically on the degree of the PCV and the singularity of the integral kernel. Specifically, for kernels of the form $|x-y|^{-\alpha}(\alpha>-1)$, the method achieves high-order convergence if and only if $p(1-\alpha) \in \mathbb{N}$. This relationship highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate degree $p$ for the PCV. A new error estimate in a framework where convergence is achieved by reducing the approximating domain size while keeping the number of discretization points fixed is derived for the Fej\'er first quadrature, decay rate of Chebyshev coefficients, and the error in approximating continuous Chebyshev coefficients with discrete ones. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, showcasing the effectiveness of the RP strategy for accurately solving singular integral equations. As an application of the method, numerical solutions of the surface scattering problem in the two dimensions are computed for complex domains, and the algorithm's efficacy is demonstrated for large-scale problems.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.07946v1,A semi-implicit exactly fully well-balanced relaxation scheme for the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations,C. Caballero-Cárdenas; I. Gómez-Bueno; A. del Grosso; J. Koellermeier; T. Morales de Luna,"When dealing with shallow water simulations, the velocity profile is often assumed to be constant along the vertical axis. However, since in many applications this is not the case, modeling errors can be significant. Hence, in this work, we deal with the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations (SWLME), in which the velocity is no longer constant in the vertical direction, where a polynomial expansion around the mean value is considered. The linearized version implies neglecting the non-linear terms of the basis coefficients in the higher order equations. As a result, the model is always hyperbolic and the stationary solutions can be more easily computed. Then, our objective is to propose an efficient, accurate and robust numerical scheme for the SWLME model, specially adapted for low Froude number situations. Hence, we describe a semi-implicit second order exactly fully well-balanced method. More specifically, a splitting is performed to separate acoustic and material phenomena. The acoustic waves are treated in an implicit manner to gain in efficiency when dealing with subsonic flow regimes, whereas the second order of accuracy is achieved thanks to a polynomial reconstruction and Strang-splitting method. We also exploit a reconstruction operator to achieve the fully well-balanced character of the method. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate the well-balanced properties and large speed-up compared to traditional methods.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.07934v1,Monotonicity and convergence of two-relaxation-times lattice Boltzmann schemes for a non-linear conservation law,Denise Aregba-Driollet; Thomas Bellotti,"We address the convergence analysis of lattice Boltzmann methods for scalar non-linear conservation laws, focusing on two-relaxation-times (TRT) schemes. Unlike Finite Difference/Finite Volume methods, lattice Boltzmann schemes offer exceptional computational efficiency and parallelization capabilities. However, their monotonicity and $L^{\infty}$-stability remain underexplored. Extending existing results on simpler BGK schemes, we derive conditions ensuring that TRT schemes are monotone and stable by leveraging their unique relaxation structure. Our analysis culminates in proving convergence of the numerical solution to the weak entropy solution of the conservation law. Compared to BGK schemes, TRT schemes achieve reduced numerical diffusion while retaining provable convergence. Numerical experiments validate and illustrate the theoretical findings.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.07929v1,Computing the $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs of signed graphs,Chuanyuan Ge; Ouyuan Qin,"As a nonlinear extension of the graph Laplacian, the graph $p$-Laplacian has various applications in many fields. Due to the nonlinearity, it is very difficult to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of graph $p$-Laplacian. In this paper, we establish the equivalence between the graph $p$-Laplacian eigenproblem and the tensor eigenproblem when $p$ is even. Building on this result, algorithms designed for tensor eigenproblems can be adapted to compute the eigenpairs of the graph $p$-Laplacian. For general $p>1$, we give a fast and convergent algorithm to compute the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunction of the signless graph $p$-Laplacian. As an application, we provide a new criterion to determine when a graph is not a subgraph of another one, which outperforms existing criteria based on the linear Laplacian and adjacency matrices. Our work highlights the deep connections and numerous similarities between the spectral theories of tensors and graph $p$-Laplacians.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.07914v1,Using curved meshes to derive a priori error estimates for a linear elasticity problem with Robin boundary conditions,Joyce Ghantous,"This work concerns the numerical analysis of the linear elasticity problem with a Robin boundary condition on a smooth domain. A finite element discretization is presented using high-order curved meshes in order to accurately discretize the physical domain. The primary objective is to conduct a detailed error analysis for the elasticity problem using the vector lift operator, which maps vector-valued functions from the mesh domain to the physical domain. Error estimates are established, both in terms of the finite element approximation error and the geometric error, respectively associated to the finite element degree and to the mesh order. These theoretical a priori error estimates are validated by numerical experiments in 2D and 3D.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.07904v1,Effective algorithms for tensor train decomposition via the UTV framework,Yuchao Wang; Maolin Che; Yimin Wei,"The tensor train (TT) decomposition is used to compress large tensors into a more compact form by exploiting their inherent data structures. A fundamental approach for constructing the TT format is the TT-SVD, which extracts the TT-cores by the singular value decompositions (SVDs) sequentially. But in practical applications, it is often not necessary to compute full SVDs. In this article, we therefore propose a new method called the TT-UTV. It utilizes the virtues of rank-revealing UTV decomposition to compute the TT format for a large-scale tensor, hence requires less computational cost. We analyze the error bounds on the accuracy of these algorithms both in the URV and ULV cases, then recommend different sweep patterns for these two cases. We perform numerical experiments on some applications, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data completion, to illustrate their good performance in practice.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.07863v5,An accelerated gradient method with adaptive restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems,Hao Luo; Liping Tang; Xinmin Yang,"In this work, based on the continuous time approach, we propose an accelerated gradient method with adaptive residual restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems. For the first, we derive rigorously the continuous limit of the multiobjective accelerated proximal gradient method by Tanabe et al. [Comput. Optim. Appl., 2023]. It is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that involves a special projection operator and can be viewed as an extension of the ODE by Su et al. [J. Mach. Learn. Res., 2016] for Nesterov acceleration. Then, we introduce a novel accelerated multiobjective gradient (AMG) flow with tailored time scaling that adapts automatically to the convex case and the strongly convex case, and the exponential decay rate of a merit function along with the solution trajectory of AMG flow is established via the Lyapunov analysis. After that, we consider an implicit-explicit time discretization and obtain an accelerated multiobjective gradient method with a convex quadratic programming subproblem. The fast sublinear rate and linear rate are proved respectively for convex and strongly convex problems. In addition, we present an efficient residual based adaptive restart technique to overcome the oscillation issue and improve the convergence significantly. Numerical results are provided to validate the practical performance of the proposed method.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.07778v1,A Low-Rank QTT-based Finite Element Method for Elasticity Problems,Elena Benvenuti; Gianmarco Manzini; Marco Nale; Simone Pizzolato,"We present an efficient and robust numerical algorithm for solving the two-dimensional linear elasticity problem that combines the Quantized Tensor Train format and a domain partitioning strategy. This approach makes it possible to solve the linear elasticity problem on a computational domain that is more general than a square. Our method substantially decreases memory usage and achieves a notable reduction in rank compared to established Finite Element implementations like the FEniCS platform. This performance gain, however, requires a fundamental rethinking of how core finite element operations are implemented, which includes changes to mesh discretization, node and degree of freedom ordering, stiffness matrix and internal nodal force assembly, and the execution of algebraic matrix-vector operations. In this work, we discuss all these aspects in detail and assess the method's performance in the numerical approximation of three representative test cases.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.07702v1,Convergence of Multi-Level Hybrid Monte Carlo Methods for 1-D Particle Transport Problems,Vincent N. Novellino; Dmitriy Y. Anistratov,"We present in this paper a hybrid, Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for solving the neutral particle transport equation. MLMC methods, originally developed to solve parametric integration problems, work by using a cheap, low fidelity solution as a base solution and then solves for additive correction factors on a sequence of computational grids. The proposed algorithm works by generating a scalar flux sample using a Hybrid Monte Carlo method based on the low-order Quasidiffusion equations. We generate an initial number of samples on each grid and then calculate the optimal number of samples to perform on each level using MLMC theory. Computational results are shown for a 1-D slab model to demonstrate the weak convergence of considered functionals. The analyzed functionals are integrals of the scalar flux solution over either the whole domain or over a specific subregion. We observe the variance of the correction factors decreases faster than increase in the cost of generating a MLMC sample grows. The variance and costs of the MLMC solution are driven by the coarse grid calculations. Therefore, we should be able to add additional computational levels at minimal cost since fewer samples would be needed to converge estimates of the correction factors on subsequent levels.",NA,NA,0,1
2501.07700v3,An Adaptive Collocation Point Strategy For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method,Adrian Celaya; David Fuentes; Beatrice Riviere,"Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose an adaptive collocation point selection strategy utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs, including the wave, Allen-Cahn, and Burgers' equations, demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approach improves PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.",NA,NA,0,1

We consider the set of points $z \in \mathbb{C}$ where the relative difference in 2-norm between the resolvent and the nearest rank one matrix is less than a given number $\epsilon \in (0,1)$. We establish a relationship between this set and the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum of $A$, and we derive specific results about this set for Jordan blocks and for a class of large Toeplitz matrices. We also derive disks about the eigenvalues of $A$ that are contained in this set, and this leads to some new results on disks about the eigenvalues that are contained in the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum of $A$. In addition, we consider the set of points $z \in \mathbb{C}$ where the absolute value of the inner product of the left and right singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular value of the resolvent is less than $\epsilon$. We demonstrate numerically that this set can be almost as large as the one where the relative difference between the resolvent and the nearest rank one matrix is less than $\epsilon$ and we give a partial explanation for this. Some possible applications are discussed.",NA,NA,0,1
